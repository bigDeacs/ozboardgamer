Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yield the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money - acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige - while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they&#39;ve placed their workers next to on the action board.After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they&#39;ve completed their work, and their money on hand. The player with the most points wins.

Prior to the Napoleon wars, the Austrian Empire stretched from Italy to the Netherlands and from Poland to the Balkans. Its position in the center of Europe, however, made it the perfect target for revolutionary France and in April 1792, France declared war on Austria. The first war lasted for 5 years. Austria renewed the war against France in 1799 and again in 1805, but in both cases was swiftly defeated. In April 1809, judging that Napoleon&#39;s army was bogged down with the fighting in Spain, Austria invaded Bavaria, but Napoleon recovered quickly and Austria&#39;s defeat at Wagram led to another humiliating peace treaty. In 1812 Austria was forced to provide troops for Napoleon&#39;s disastrous Russian campaign, but in 1813 Austria again joined the coalition against him. Even though the Austrian army was the third largest in the world, the Austrians lost many more battles than they won. At the time of the Napoleonic Wars, the Austrian army was a large multi-national army, made up of Austrians, Swedes, Hungarians, Englishmen, Scots, Irishmen, Walloons, Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Croats, Serbs, and even French royalists. The infantry regiments were large and somewhat reliable, but the tactical formations and drill were still entrenched in the past. The cavalry, although well mounted, still applied the practice of scattering their formations in small bodies, which greatly reduced their combat effectiveness. In general, the Austrian army did enjoy many successes on a regimental level, but at the brigade and divisional levels its commanders were not tactically proficient. In this expansion you will find 18 historical scenarios that focus on the Austrian Army battles from 1805 to 1814 against Napoleon, plus all the new units you&#39;ll need to field for these engagements.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972517,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/commands-and-colors-napoleonics-expansion-the-austrian-army?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972517.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972517@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972517@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972517@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972517@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972517@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972517@400x400.jpg,81.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples &ndash; in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game. The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired: &nbsp;Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc. &nbsp;Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them. &nbsp;Toss a vehicle: If you&#39;re in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster. &nbsp;Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster&#39;s body and blowing across the board. Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game&#39;s end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card. In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that&#39;s revealed only upon use. Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972519,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/terror-in-meeple-city?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972519.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972519@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972519@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972519@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972519@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972519@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972519@400x400.jpg,73.99 AUD,ASMODEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the players must buy their resources on a limited resource market, which does not always guarantee enough resources for all players.

Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they&#39;ve ever known, and you may use them at your whim. The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future. The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past. There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways. In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas. Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker&#39;s knowledge &ndash; that is, his level of awareness that he&#39;s in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game...or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you. Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts &ndash; especially matching pairs &ndash; and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them. Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972529,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/euphoria-build-a-better-dystopia?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@400x400.jpg,77.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions. Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge. A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan. SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time. Each unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad.

They explore, using a new movement mechanic, for the raw materials they need to build the settlement. Along the way, they discover useful natural products - but also encounter wild animals and are confronted with adventurous situations. Those who survive these encounters obtain the raw materials they sought as well as experience points that improve the abilities of the player&#39;s character. Over time, then, the player becomes stronger, smarter or more charismatic and is better and better suited for the dangers of the wild. Back in the village, the natural products can be used to brew beverages while the raw materials are used for building. Through this building, the settlement grows and players obtain victory points.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises. It&#39;s up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins. You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave. Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.

Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected. Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends). From the publisher: Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes! In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed. The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately. Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects. Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.

With roots tracing back to Avalon Hill&#39;s classic Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, and to its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War takes this popular gaming system even further, clearing up ambiguities and adding more detail to what was already a fine family of wargames. Developed through a decade of design and playtesting, A World at War has it all: marines and paratroopers clashing with armor and infantry; subs and carriers sparring with cruisers and battlewagons; army planes and carrier planes mixing it up with bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide what to build and where to deploy it--in Europe or the Pacific, on the eastern front or the Med. Armaments, however, don&#39;t constitute the only battlefield. The struggle extends into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy, and into your own skunk works, through research. So seize every advantage, not just in air range and detonators but also in oil and winter boots. Even puny partisans can play a part, for unwatched they&#39;ll wreak havoc behind your lines. Above all stay flexible and keep a sure eye on your enemy. And when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, go surge-research the atomic bomb, or take the exigency--less risky and less glitzy--of fortifying your beaches and building flak near your factories. (The mocking will come later, like how you cracked too few encryptions, gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk.) For this is A World a War, a game of interwoven strategies and anguished choices. But if you soldier through to match the right weapons to the right assaults and then hit hard enough--who knows?--you just might knock those rivals to their knees! A World at War, a game that has it all. Warfare not only on the land, under the sea, and in the air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on the lab bench and in the diplomatic pouch. Master every sphere, weather every setback, and you&#39;ll earn that rare chance to conquer armies and rule nations . . . even if they&#39;re only cardboard.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972600,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/a-world-at-war?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972600.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972600@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972600@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972600@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972600@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972600@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972600@400x400.jpg,242.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why? Because you&#39;re a virus, and that&#39;s your job. Pandemic: Contagion includes a deck of contagion cards with differing colored borders, city cards, event/WHO cards, virus cubes. On a turn you take two actions; three actions are available, and you can take the same action twice. Those actions are: Draw contagion cards equal to your current infection rate. Discard enough contagion cards to advance a mutation to the next level, thereby allowing you to draw more cards, place more cubes, or resist human counter-attacks. Discard contagion cards matching the color of the city you want to start to infect (two cards) or infect more (one card), using any two cards as a joker, if you wish. Place cubes equal to your current transmission rate. Each city card has a colored border (with all cities on the same continent having a matching border), a special action awarded to the player who places the final cube on the card, and three numbers; the large number shows the number of cubes needed to close the city and the number of points scored by whoever has the majority of cubes in this city when it closes, while the two smaller numbers show the points awarded to those with the second- and third-most cubes. At the start of each round after the first, you draw the top card from the event/WHO deck. Events take place at the start, end or middle of your turn, as specified on the card, and they might benefit or harm you directly &mdash; say, by giving you a contagion card for each city you infect or forcing you to remove cubes from the board &mdash; or they might affect what&#39;s possible on a turn, such as making it more or less costly to infect a city. The WHO cards are generally bad for you, but your resistance allows you to lessen whatever the penalty would be based on its level. Need to remove three cubes from the board? If your resistance is at level 3, drop it down one level and you don&#39;t have to remove any. Some event cards feature a city icon, which brings a new city card into play, or a skull; when the second skull comes out, you have an intermediate scoring round in which whoever has the most cubes in a city scores points equal to the lowest value in that city. Once the event/WHO deck runs out or only two city cards remain in play, the game ends, with players conducting a final scoring round to see which virus is victorious.

Each 100-gun ship had an established complement of 850 men in addition to extras assigned when used as flagships.HMS Royal George was ordered under the name &quot;Umpire&quot;, and was built to counter the much enlarged French three-deckers built during the American Revolutionary War. She was renamed in late 1783 for the Royal George lost at Spithead in 1782.

If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&nbsp;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:&nbsp; Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good. Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit. Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect. Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies. Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else. When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who&#39;s reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.

Early encounters have only served to prove that the worlds militaries are hopelessly out-gunned. Panic leads to riots and governments struggle to maintain any control. Human civilization is on the brink of collapse. As the department heads of XCOM you and your friends must succeed where the worlds militaries have failed. You lead the elite members of an international, military organisation which is funded by a secret coalition. It is your job to destroy UFOs, research Alien technology uncover the alien invasion plan and find some way to turn back the alien invaders. You must do this all while preventing the collapse of the governments that secretly fund your organisation.&nbsp; Paris has fallen. New York is a pile of rubble spilling into the Atlantic. Alien attacks against Nanjing and Changzhou prompt widespread panic throughout the streets of Shanghai. Defense satellites detect UFOs in orbit over Mexico, Russia, and Brazil. Military responses have proven ineffectual. Fear and anxiety lead to widespread riots. Human civilization stands upon the brink of collapse&hellip;&nbsp;You are humanity&rsquo;s last hope.&nbsp;In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM. It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&nbsp;Where the world&rsquo;s militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base, all while you try to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&nbsp; Innovative Digital Enhancement&nbsp;The most notable aspect of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay, then uses the app to promote a unique play experience unlike anything you and your friends have previously encountered in a board game. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&nbsp;The app&rsquo;s primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heighten&rsquo;s the game&rsquo;s tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion&#39;s next strikes. Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&nbsp; A crisis card The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time. It also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase.&nbsp;As a result, while you&rsquo;ll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&nbsp;The effect of the app, then, is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you&rsquo;ll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail Players 1-4 Playing time 60 - 120 minutes",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972628,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/xcom-the-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972628.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972628@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972628@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972628@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972628@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972628@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972628@400x400.jpg,75.99 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&nbsp;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&nbsp;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&nbsp;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault. With these Imperial Assault Figure Packs, you&rsquo;ll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside these iconic characters from the Star Wars saga.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972640,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/star-wars-imperial-assault?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972640.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972640@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972640@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972640@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972640@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972640@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972640@400x400.jpg,156.49 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some believe that he has always guarded the manor house, even before the death of the High Mage that lived there. Others suggest that he was unintentionally created from residual magic released by the wizard&#39;s death. Still others would say that the ravens created a new guardian after the passing of their old master. Whether Skarn is a raging monster hungry for power or a misunderstood soul devoted to a lonely cause, all agree that Skarn&#39;s potential stretches far beyond what can be allowed.&nbsp;Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) &ndash; Skarn Lieutenant Pack includes a detailed, sculpted plastic figure of Skarn to replace the lieutenant token included in the Manor of Ravens expansion as well as a ten-card Plot deck that lets you spread Skarn&#39;s regenerative abilities to the monsters under your command.&nbsp;This Plot deck also gives you the opportunity to unleash Skarn on Terrinoth by summoning him into battle as your agent in any quest that does not include him as a lieutenant. In battle, heroes will find Skarn a powerful opponent, resilient to damage and able to mend his own wounds in the heat of combat. What&#39;s more, Skarn&#39;s attacks frequently damage more than one hero, possibly threatening an entire hero party at once if they move in too close.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972644,http://www.ozgameshop.com/board-game-expansions/descent-journeys-into-the-dark-2nd-edition-skarn-lieutenant-pack?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@400x400.jpg,21.99 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game is accessible to casual as well as expert gamers, and has a mature theme. The rules of ILLEGAL are simple, but the game will challenge your skills in negotiation, misdirection, discretion, charisma, and persuasion. The more you play, the more you will learn to expand and master these skills. Each game lasts about half an hour, and is packed with intense exchanges, interactions and a lot of humour.&nbsp;Launch into this risqu&eacute; adventure! Dare to become one of these offbeat dealers and get a good laugh with your friends.&nbsp;How to Play&nbsp;ILLEGAL is played in two phases:&nbsp;During the first phase, each player receives a deck of cards prepared by the Game Master (GM). These decks assign each player his dealer role and gives him a good quantity of the corresponding resources. Each player&#39;s deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.&nbsp;Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.&nbsp;The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.&nbsp;At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.&nbsp;Scoring&nbsp;At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972645,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/illegal-party-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@400x400.jpg,24.99 AUD,ASMODEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Worlds of Danger... Darkness Everywhere... At the dawning of the sixth millennium A.D. an Emperor has claimed the Phoenix Throne and united the Known Worlds following three decades of interstellar civil war. Still, the peace is precarious and many forces threaten the Empire: ambitious nobles fight to increase their power; greedy merchants grab for wealth; power-hungry priests dream of theocracy; foul antinomists traffic in dark powers; barbarian cultures stand poised to invade; resentful aliens seek revenge from millennia of human oppression; and countless others.

Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3-6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner&#39;s circle looking in. The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time: Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack. Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together. Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front. Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation. Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What&#39;s more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds? Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other. The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned (triangle) raceway. Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best. An unusual bonus for Thunder Alley is the very playable and exciting two-player version with six cars on a side.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972662,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/thunder-alley?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972662.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972662@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972662@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972662@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972662@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972662@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972662@400x400.jpg,119.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the city&#39;s growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals, and win elections. &nbsp; In Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes, and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayor&#39;s grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try to take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy. &nbsp; Tammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations. While the organization&#39;s influence spanned from its founding in the 1790s to its collapse in the 1960s, this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870 &ndash; the era of Boss Tweed. &nbsp; Ages 12 Players 3-5 Playing Time 60-90 Minutes",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972676,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/tammany-hall?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972676.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972676@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972676@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972676@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972676@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972676@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972676@400x400.jpg,82.49 AUD,IDW Publishing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Roberts Award nominee, covers the first three months of the war on the Western Front, as Imperial Germany gambled its future on a decisive victory over the armies of France, Belgium, and Great Britain. The resulting stalemate doomed all of Europe to over 4 years of blood and destruction. 1914: Glory&#39;s End manages to cover all the important characteristics of the campaign, with rules for Prepared and March Combat, trenches, forts, cavalry, command and control breakdowns, supply, strategic rail movement, Allied sea movement, German forced marching, Plan XVII, and more - all while remaining easy to play. The campaign game runs a full 30 turns, but the game includes both a mini-scenario on the Battle of the Marne and a short ten turn campaign scenario covering the decisive opening weeks of the war. In addition, the campaign games can be played in historical or free set-up versions. When Eagles Fight: This revised and improved edition of the Charles S. Roberts Award winner for best pre-WWII game recreates the titanic struggle of the Eastern Front on the Great War from the initial clashes at Tannenberg to the revolution that brought down Tsar Nicholas II. When Eagles Fight has a set of low complexity rules which don&#39;t sacrifice the historical feel of these massive campaigns. Rules cover German Heavy Artillery, the OberOst and Stavka Headquarters, Russian ammunition shortages, fortifications, the Brusilov Offensive, the slow pace of Russian mobilization, and Austrian Lock-Step Planning in the opening days of the war. A Random Events table covers the effects of the war&#39;s other fronts, and a short &quot;What if?&quot; scenario is included assuming an initial German concentration in the east in August 1914.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972692,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/1914-glorys-end-when-eagles-fight?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972692.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972692@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972692@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972692@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972692@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972692@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972692@400x400.jpg,78.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Players start with 21 points of health (or 18 in a tag-team match) and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent&#39;s strength points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a &quot;count of three&quot; to win by a pin.&nbsp;The player sitting near the &#39;red&#39; corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 &#39;red&#39; wrestling dice, the player near the &#39;blue&#39; corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice. Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die.&nbsp;Players begin by each rolling their own set of &#39;wrestling dice&#39; at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring.&nbsp;The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc. Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit. If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler&#39;s trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent.&nbsp;Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled. If PIN comes up, the &#39;three count&#39; begins. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using their wrestling dice or lose the match.&nbsp;In a tag-team match players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them..., if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent. 16 Wrestling Dice in 4 Colours (4 Dice in Red, Blue, Purple and Pink)&nbsp; 4 Green Hit Dice&nbsp; 4 Yellow Pin Dice&nbsp; 2 Black Luchador Dice&nbsp; The Luchador Arena&nbsp; 9 Luchador Cut-outs&nbsp;8 Plastic Stands&nbsp; 9 Luchador Superstar Cards&nbsp; 9 Advanced Luchador Cards&nbsp; 8 Strength Score Cards&nbsp; 8 Strength Score Markers&nbsp; 1 Three-Dimensional Luchador Ring&nbsp;The World Championship Title Belt&nbsp; The Tag-Team Championship Title Belt&nbsp;8 Combat Order Disks",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972695,http://www.ozgameshop.com/dice-games/luchador-mexican-wrestling-dice?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972695.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972695@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972695@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972695@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972695@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972695@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972695@400x400.jpg,51.99 AUD,Backspindle Games Ltd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each player secretly &quot;owns&quot; two of the twelve characters in the house, and each character starts in a different room of the house. On a turn, a player either moves any character that is alone in a room into an adjacent room or starts a fight in a room that contains at least two characters. Well, it&#39;s not much of a fight really, as the player removes one character from the room and places it in a line with other removed characters. Once a single character remains, the round ends. The first two characters removed are worth zero points, while the third through eleventh characters are worth 1-9 points; the character that remains in the house is worth ten points. Each player collects points only for his most valuable character. &nbsp; The player with the most points after three rounds wins.

The expansion is based on an idea of Michael Ormesher in a Days of Wonder &quot;Race design contest&quot;. The expansion consists of 24 leader tokens that are neither a race nor a power. When you pick a new race, you can opt to buy its leader. The leader acts as an additional race token. The leader, however, disappears as soon as the race goes into decline. Also, the leader is brave, which means that he can only be staying at regions that are not immune. Leaders can be held hostage for ransom. If the ransom is not paid, the leader counts as two victory points at the end of the game for the player that captured the leader.

You use these cards to bomb and drill minerals and other bonuses from the game board. You then use the minerals you&#39;ve collected as money to purchase better cards for your deck. Some cards give you an immediate bonus when you purchase them, and some give you other bonuses when you use them to drill. Each card you purchase from your library is worth victory points (VPs). You can also gain VPs from achievement cards that become available throughout the game. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins. Super Motherload features game boards that are added and removed during play to create videogame-like scrolling action, and it challenges spatial relation skills for 2-4 players who love video games, Eurostyle board games, or deck-building card games.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972731,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/super-motherload?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972731.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972731@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972731@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972731@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972731@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972731@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972731@400x400.jpg,81.49 AUD,Roxley Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You mark a shop to show ownership, and when tourists show up later, they will shop at various stores depending on their proximity and the goods they offer.

In Dungeon Lords, you are an evil dungeon lord who is trying to build the best dungeon out there. You hire monsters, build rooms, buy traps and defeat the do-gooders who wish to bring you down. Each turn, players use a hand of cards to choose where to place their worker imps. Actions vary from mining gold, hiring monsters, buying traps etc. Each action has three spots available - with each spot having different effects (e.g., mining gold lets you mine more gold in each spot). When using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn. The entire game lasts two &quot;game years&quot;, and each year consists of four seasons (a.k.a. turns). At the start of each season, players see the heroes and events to come in the following season, allowing them to prepare. At the end of each season after the first, heroes are allocated to each player according to the players&#39; level of evilness. Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves. Each hero has its own power for which the player needs to prepare for. At the end of each year, the heroes travel into the dungeons to fight. Scoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured. The Festival Season expansion adds a fifth season to the year: festival season. More time to build your dungeon, but also more time for adventurers to gather a larger party. There are new monsters, rooms, and traps to prepare your dungeon for the battle, but also new nasty spells for the adventurers and sneaky bards who encourage them to perform so-called &quot;heroic&quot; deeds &ndash; not to mention two paladins for each year, now ready to punish up to two evil players. Would you like to push other players toward evil instead of moving yourself toward good when visiting the city? What about making an investment instead of traditional gold digging? Or what about repairing conquered tunnels or rooms instead of digging new ones? Only eight actions are still available to you, but each season one of those actions is replaced by an alternate set of spaces that offer new and intriguing options. And did we mention that it has recently become fashionable for dungeon lords to have their own personal pets?",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972758,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-board-games/dungeon-lords-happy-anniversary?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@400x400.jpg,152.99 AUD,Czech Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The humiliation of military defeat forced the Prussian king into much-needed military reform. The new Prussian army that emerged became one of the finest in Europe., due in part to the organizational genius of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and in part due to Field-Marshal Prince Bl&#39;cher, who drove his regiments to fight with relentless vigor. In 1813 Prussia rejoined the war against Napoleonic France and the Prussian army under Bl&#39;cher, although sometimes playing second fiddle to Austria, Russia and Great Britain, was a major force in bringing an end to Napoleon Bonaparte&#39;s rule. The Prussians played a major part in Napoleon&#39;s defeat at Waterloos. Prussia&#39;s reward was the recovery of her lost territories, as well as the whole of the Rhineland and Westphalia. Prussia therefore emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the dominant power in Germany.&nbsp;",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972770,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/commands-and-colors-napoleonics-prussian-army?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972770.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972770@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972770@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972770@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972770@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972770@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972770@400x400.jpg,86.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deceive your opponents as an agent secretly working for a European power, recruiting key assets, buying off politicians, and instigating sabotage against foreign capitals. However, you will need the reluctant (or unwitting) support of your opponents to position your homeland for European domination, so tread carefully and do not reveal your true identity. &nbsp; Game Overview: At the start of the game, you receive an Alignment Token, which tells you which one of the competing European nations you secretly work for. &nbsp; The rest of the game unfolds over the course of 14 rounds, with each player (spy) performing 3 Actions per round. These actions include moving around the map, acquiring resources in the form of Supply Tokens, improving your abilities by recruiting Assets, manipulating the otherwise-random Politicians to your advantage, or even directly harassing opposing spies. &nbsp; But any action you take will directly affect at least one Nation, in the form of gains or losses in Influence points.

In a Scoring Phase, each Nation receives Power points, based on how much Influence it has accumulated so far. &nbsp; At the end of the game, players reveal their Alignment Tokens, and the player whose Nation has the most Power is the winner.

You&#39;re eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.&nbsp;The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round. Players take action in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom, and on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).&nbsp;For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space. The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display. The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.&nbsp;For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region. If this seat isn&#39;t in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy. You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure &mdash; possibly a noble if the seat demands it &mdash; in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region. When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it.&nbsp;After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round &mdash; but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.) and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.) If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once. Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game. Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys.&nbsp;To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions. As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners. After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins.&nbsp; Players 2-5 Playing time 40 minutes Suggested ages 10",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972775,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/the-stauffer-dynasty?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972775.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972775@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972775@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972775@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972775@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972775@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972775@400x400.jpg,96.99 AUD,MAN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &mdash; and, of course, score points. &nbsp; The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces. &nbsp; On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card. &nbsp; After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card. &nbsp; Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player&#39;s scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points). &nbsp; Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don&#39;t have an animal of that tpe you don&#39;t get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972789,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/la-isla?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@400x400.jpg,59.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They scuttle in the darkness of dank under hives. They lurk in the corners of gilded palaces. They even dare to stand openly hiding behind false faces and honeyed words. They are everywhere that man live and breathe - and so we must always be ready to face them with fire and the Emperors wrath. Cults fester throughout the Askellon sector. Only the valour and vigilance of the Ordo Hereticus prevent the Imperium from tearing itself apart in a blood-soaked spasm of fear and madness. These men and women of the Inquisition stride through worlds rotting beneath the heresy of cultists mutants and witches. It falls to these fearless Acolytes to bank the coals and stoke the flames bringing the purifying fire of the Emperor to every corner of the galaxy.

There&#39;s no place like home. Building a covenant from scratch can be a lot of work for players, as well as magi, so this book provides five fully detailed covenants, one for each season from Spring to Second Spring, each set in a different Tribunal.

This track offers an urban terrain which alternates between curves and straight lines. This mad race in the heart of city traffic will give drivers a chance to drive along the impressive Aon Center, one of the tallest skyscrapers of the city, to cross the Lake Shore East Park and its three tightly woven lanes (be careful about collisions!), and then rush along the inner port before finally crossing two vertigo-inducing bridges.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972826,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/formula-d-expansion-1-sebring-and-chicago?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972826.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972826@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972826@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972826@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972826@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972826@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972826@400x400.jpg,38.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this crucial period the Germans had their only chance to push back the Allied invasion before the preponderance of Allied men and material made the outcome certain. During this period, the U.S. 1st Army fought across the Cotentin Peninsula and captured the major port of Cherbourg while British forces took on the bulk of of the German panzer divisions near Caen. Each turn represents 1 day. Each hex represents 3.8 kilometers (or 2.3 miles). Most units are regiments or brigades though most of the armor units are represented as battalions. The game uses a simplified Ardennes &#39;44 system: Move, Fight and Reserve Movement. All non-tank battalion units are rated for Troop Quality, while all armor units have a Tank Rating. In each battle these ratings are used to provide shifts for either the attacker or defender. Other important shifts are provided by air power, naval support, artillery and/or Tiger tanks. The game includes a 22 turn Campaign game, a 7-turn Tournament Scenario that focuses on the Allies linking up the beaches, and a scenario covering the battle in the peninsula and the capture of Cherbourg. In addition, there are rules for allowing 3 or even 4 players to play the game.

Coordinate allied attacks to secure victory, but watch your flanks!&nbsp; Nika, inspired by ancient Greek geography &amp; warfare, is based around two core mechanisms: facing and formations. Pieces can be routed off the board if attacked from the side or back, but not from the front. A routed piece can rally back onto the board at the cost of an action. Your pieces can move or rotate together in a phalanx if they are adjacent and facing the same way, and you can push back enemies facing you if your phalanx is deeper than theirs. &nbsp; There are four cities: Athens (white) and Messene (blue) are allied against Sparta (red) and Thebes (black). Allies start across the board from each other, and you win by getting a piece into your victory area in the heart of your ally&#39;s territory. Each two-city alliance can be played either solo or with a partner, so the game can support two, three, or four players. &nbsp; Every player has enemies on both sides, making the distribution of both pieces and actions between fronts a strategic and often tactical consideration. Maneuvering, timing, coordination, and sacrifice are all key elements of strategy. &nbsp; Says designer Josh Raab, &quot;Nika is the ancient Greek word for &#39;conquer&#39;. The concept of Nika came to me in a dream while I was studying abroad in Athens. The rules were honed across nearly two years of testing. The board shape and core mechanics were inspired by ancient Greek geography and warfare. Greece has many narrow valleys and mountain passes, and sometimes the only way to defeat an enemy force was to collide with them head-on and literally push them off the field. This othismos (&#39;shoving&#39;) is thought to have been the critical phase of most battles between hoplite armies, who were the heavy infantry that dominated ancient Greek war for four centuries.&quot;&nbsp; Players 2-4 Playing Time 30 Minutes Suggested ages 8",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972864,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/nika?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972864.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972864@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972864@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972864@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972864@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972864@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972864@400x400.jpg,41.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It takes seconds to learn, minutes to play and provides endless learning opportunities. One thing you should know from the start is that it&#39;s not your typical board game. Naturally, there are rules you have to follow and there&#39;s a beginning and an end, but there&#39;s no single winner. In Robot Turtles, everyone plays to get their Turtle to the matching Jewel. It doesn&#39;t matter who gets there first, everyone can win. It&#39;s not about competition, but about having fun AND-shhhh, don&#39;t tell the kids-learning.&nbsp;The inventor of Robot Turtles, Dan Shapiro, is a programmer and a dad. He came up with Robot Turtles to give his kids what he feels is the single greatest superpower-the skill of programming. He created the game just like a video game with cool obstacles and powers that you can unlock along the way-this keeps the game fresh. The recent changes in the UK National Curriculum mean that Children will have to learn basic computer programming at Primary school - Robot Turtles gives your little Turtle Masters the opportunity to learn basic coding in a fun way - without parents needing a background in computing to help them!&nbsp;Players dictate the movements of their Robot Turtle tokens on a game board by playing Code Cards: Forward, Left and Right. When a player&#39;s Robot Turtle reaches a jewel they win! If they make a mistake, they can use a Bug Card to undo a move. The game has many levels so, as the players advance, they will encounter obstacles like Ice Walls and use more complex Code Cards (like lasers to melt the walls). Play continues until all players collect a jewel, so everyone wins. Beginner to Advanced levels will make it a family favorite for many years. It includes a large Game Board, 40 Tiles, 4 Robot Turtle Tiles, 4 Jewel Tiles, 4 Code Card Decks (45 cards in each deck) and instructions. 2-5 players can play at once and everyone who gets the Robot Jewel wins.&nbsp; Teach Children as young as 4 the basics of computer programming As children gain confidence they can go on to more &#39;unlockable&#39; No reading required and it takes seconds to learn how to play Educational game designed to be played with parents or an older sibling Teaches skills required by the new National Curriculum",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972883,http://www.ozgameshop.com/childrens-board-games/thinkfun-robot-turtles-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972883.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972883@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972883@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972883@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972883@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972883@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972883@400x400.jpg,46.99 AUD,Think Fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everyone speculated, and many become millionaires overnight. &nbsp; In Mogul &mdash; a revised and expanded version of the 2002 game of the same name &mdash; players buy and sell railway stock, trying to outsmart both the opponents and the market. Each of the five railroad companies has five to eight shares, and in addition to being a share of the company, each share card has a box on it that indicates another company. Players start with particular stock holdings based on the number of players in the game and their position in turn order. &nbsp; Each turn, one stock card is revealed from the deck. Players earn $1 for each share of this color that they own, then an auction ensues. Turn by turn, players must drop one of their bidding chips into a bowl in order to stay in the auction. When a player passes, whether by necessity or choice, they take all of the chips from the bowl, thereby earning bidding power for future auctions. &nbsp; When all but one player has passed, this last player wins the auction and has the right to either keep the share or sell stock matching the color of the company depicted on the bottom of the share; the player who dropped out of the auction last takes the action that the winner didn&#39;t take. If a player sells stock, they either sell all shares of this color that they own, earning as much for each share as the number of those stock cards face up on the table or they sell none of them; in the latter case, the player places a station depot in their color on an empty space of the appropriate color on the game board. This game board has multiple networks in the five colors of the game, and at game&#39;s end each depot has a dollar value equal to the number of that player&#39;s depots in the same network. &nbsp; When the crash card is revealed from the deck, the game ends. Players earn $1 for each share still in front of them and each five bidding chips they hold, in addition to the value of their depots. Whoever has the most money wins!

The game consists of four location boards and a number of character cards. Each scenario features a number of characters, hidden roles for these characters (serial killer, conspiracy theorist, friend), and some pre-set tragedies (murder, suicide).&nbsp;Each &quot;day&quot; (turn), players and the mastermind play three face-down cards onto the characters, then reveal them to move the characters around or affect their paranoia or goodwill stats. At the end of each day (turn), if the scenario has a tragedy set for that day, it happens if the conditions are met, i.e., certain characters have certain stats or are in a certain location together (or not together) with others. As tragedies happen, players loop back in time, restarting the scenario from the beginning and trying to deduce who the culprit was and why the tragedy occurred.&nbsp;The players win if they manage to maintain status quo &mdash; that is, if no tragedies occur to the key individuals &mdash; for a set number of days, within a set number of loops.

NeoNET and Evo are dealing with the fallout of the CFD virus, Ares has powerful forces eating it away from inside, Horizon backed the losing side of the Aztlan-Amazonia war, and the Japanacorps are rearing back to take on the world-and each other. When the corps get aggressive, shadowrunners get called, and blood gets shed. Bloody Business is a campaign book giving players the chance to earn piles of money from the megacorps as they reel through troubles and crises. It&#39;ll take a lot of good shadowrunning moves to earn that cash-and even better moves to survive long enough to collect it.

The landscape of Isle of Skye is breathtaking and fascinates everyone. In the tile-laying game Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King, 2-5 players are chieftains of famous clans and want to build their little kingdoms to score as many points as possible &mdash; but in each game only four of the sixteen scoring cards will be scored. Thanks to the scoring cards, each game is different and leads to different tactics and strategies, but having enough money is useful no matter what else is going on. Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.

It allows players to simulate the diplomatic, economic, and political maneuverings that preceded the Second World War, either as a stand alone game or as an expansion for A World at War. (Unlike Days of Decision, Gathering Storm covers only the European events leading to war.) Gathering Storm, both a game in its own right and a prequel to GMT&rsquo;s A World at War, covers the period from 1935 to the outbreak of World War II, whenever that might be. Like A World at War, Gathering Storm simulates the military, economic, political, diplomatic, research and production preparations for the Second World War, allowing the players to explore what might have happened if: - Admiral Doenitz had convinced his superiors of the importance of submarine warfare in the impending war with Britain. - Germany had pursued the Z Plan earlier and more consistently. - The development of the &ldquo;Ural bomber&rdquo; had been pursued. - Poland had become a German satellite, rather than resisting German aggression. - War had broken out over the Sudetenland, or even the remilitarization of the Rhineland. - Mussolini had given a lower priority to naval armaments, to the benefit of the Italian armor and air forces. - France had extended the Maginot Line. - de Gaulle&rsquo;s arguments to expand and strengthen France&rsquo;s armor units had been accepted. - Britain had rearmed sooner. - Russia had deferred the Great Purges. Or accelerated them. - The Spanish civil war had been won by the Loyalists. - A civil war had broken out in Yugoslavia. Or Greece. - Atomic fission had been discovered earlier. - The Second World War had begun with a Franco-Italian conflict. Or a French pre-emptive attack on Germany. Or a Russo-German war, with Italy and the Western Allies neutral. - War comes early. Or later, in 1940 or even 1941. - YOU had been in command. Gathering Storm can be played as a separate game in a single session, with its own victory conditions, but A World at War players will want to press on and see how the war they have created plays out. While using different mechanics, Gathering Storm&#39;s structure is consistent with A World at War and allows for a seamless transition to whatever alternate war the players planned &ndash; or stumbled into. Some 30 years in development, with three years of design and playtesting, Gathering Storm, includes the following: - Six random events each turn, providing unlimited replay value. - Economics based on tiles and activity counters, eliminating any paperwork. - Flexible mobilization rules, allowing players to emphasis civilian or military production &ndash; each at the expense of the other. - Unit construction which allows players to activate reserve units for immediate benefits, at a cost of limiting future options. - Variable research, which can focus on air, naval, military or intelligence projects, as well as short or long term gains. - A fast-moving diplomatic system, with each player allocating diplomatic counters each turn. Diplomatic targets are public, but the points allocated to them are not. - Shipbuilding that allows varied fleets, including the possibility of 5-factor super battleships. - Ahistorical A World at War counters, including armor units of different strengths and additional ships. - A dynamic crisis system, in which the Allies can appease or oppose the Axis, with neither side necessarily being certain whether war might break out. - No dice. Gathering Storm is a must-buy for any committed A World at War player, an excellent &ndash; and possibly dangerously time consuming &ndash; introduction to the A World at War universe for those unfamiliar with that game, and a enjoyable and instructive fast-paced game all on its own.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972913,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/gathering-storm?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@400x400.jpg,149.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This set is part of the Wellsport Brotherhood faction. &nbsp; Captain Bloody Anne Bonny For Anne Bonny, the choice between a dreary life ashore and a bold (and possibly short) life at sea was clear. She ran away with her pirate lover to Nassau port at an early age and they lived as pirates for many years. Her one regret was never commanding a ship of her own. But now, with the Locker thrown open and all those who sailed under the black flag released to the living world, she has her chance. &nbsp; Grace O Malley Gunner The legendary Pirate Queen of Ireland, Grace O Malleys legacy is well known to pirates and Irish patriots alike. As a leading figure in the Irish resistance to English conquest in the late 1500s, it could be argued that she commanded the whole of the Irish naval forces at one time. However, as she never learned English, it made her a difficult choice for captain in the largely English speaking Brotherhood. She does not seem to mind, however, and is happy to employ her services as an incredibly accomplished gunner. Her skill with paired pistols is the wonder of Wellsport. &nbsp; Theo, the Terror of Nova Quartermaster Theodore MacAdler was a bastard born of a long-dead ship captains widow. Theo grew up with a bastards stigma, and was press-ganged into the HMS Nova at age seventeen. Theos quick temper and sharp wit made him few friends and many enemies. Theo finally jumped ship and found his freedom with the Wellsport Brotherhood. He still has a little trouble keeping his mouth shut, though as Quartermaster he is only ever outranked by the Captain. &nbsp; Contents: 3 Miniatures (Unpainted) 3 Hero Cards Players: 2-6 Playing time: 60 minutes Ages: 14 and up This is not a stand alone game.

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&nbsp;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it&#39;s also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&nbsp;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players&#39; disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&nbsp;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&nbsp;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you&#39;ll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum?

The end is near. May the Maker protect us all.... &nbsp; As a player in Warband: Against the Darkness, you control the warband armies of one of the great fantasy races of the Five Realms.

It&#39;s important that your kind emerges victorious from the war with more battle prestige and honor than your temporary and untrustworthy comrades. The player who collects the most Victory Points of one-upmanship for their race by the conclusion of the final battle against the Darkness &ndash; gained by advancing your soldiers in the warband, earning gold for your army captains, reconnoitering the combat fronts with your scouts, and defeating enemies on the battlefields &ndash; has achieved the greatest leadership glory and is declared the winner. &nbsp; Warband: Against the Darkness is perfectly balanced in the design space between Euro and Ameri-style gameplay, combining strategic depth with an evocative fantasy theme and tense player conflict. &nbsp; Players 2-5 Playing time 60 minutes Suggested ages 10",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972950,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/warband-against-the-darkness?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972950.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972950@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972950@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972950@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972950@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972950@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972950@400x400.jpg,82.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caesar will reward you if you give away precious resources to build Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall thus increasing your chances of becoming Praetor. Every turn you will place your Workers on previously built City Tiles to gain resources, Morale, new Workers or Favor points. You may also assign Workers to build new City Tiles or spend resources to meet Caesar&rsquo;s demands to gain Favor Points. At the end of each turn, you will have to pay your Workers. Otherwise, the mood in the city will deteriorate. Most of the actions your Workers will perform will help them gain experience. They will become increasingly skilled in collecting resources.

New powers of interstellar travel make it possible for earthlings to find a new home. Competing teams of human explorers use space stations spread throughout the universe as bases for discovering new worlds and befriending aliens to help them in their quest. Explorer teams are not only racing each other, but meteors are striking planets and threatening these new worlds as well. Will your team be able to reach a planet in time to use its resources and protect it from future meteor strikes? Cosmic Run is a quick, push-your-luck, space race for 1-4 players. On a turn, a player rolls dice and must commit at least 1 of them to one of the various exploration tracks or to an alien card. Some of the tracks require multiple identical dice, with the most valuable tracks costing many identical dice. However, once a player commits a die, it cannot be moved. So players have to decide between a conservative approach (making sure and steady progress along less valuable tracks) or an aggressive approach (pushing one&#39;s luck to try to move up the highly valued tracks). Players may opt to use their dice to befriend aliens, rather than explore, because the aliens provide special powers that can eventually help them move along their exploration tracks even faster.

It&#39;s time to clear the way for a new bearer of the burden. She will keep a wary eye on the novices representing their Orders and trying to win her favor. Eventually, she will have to come to a decision. Which Order will prove itself worthy to decide on her successor? There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA.&quot; &quot;LUNA&quot; is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor. The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves. Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal. The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the &quot;worker movement&quot; principle, i.e. they aren&#39;t placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you&#39;re in the right place at the right time, you&#39;ll gain the deciding influence points. You&#39;ll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess&#39; divine services. But don&#39;t forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions. LUNA: In the Domain of the Moon Priestess is a challenging tactical game with strategic and interactive elements that takes about 20-25 minutes per player. The different placement of the islands and novices at the beginning of the game creates a different feeling each time you play and opens up new strategies.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973000,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/luna?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973000.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973000@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973000@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973000@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973000@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973000@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973000@400x400.jpg,88.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Founded in the times of Caesar Augustus and built up by generations of Roman architects, this was the Emperor&#39;s residence and a world city during this period. The remains of these most impressive structures can still be visited today. Foremost of these great achievements in the city is the massive &quot;Porta Nigra&quot;, a large Roman city gate located in Trier, Germany that dates to the 2nd century. The game Porta Nigra (which translates as &quot;black gate&quot;) is set in that place and time with the players taking on the roles of Roman architects working on the city gate of Porta Nigra. Each player commands a master builder, who moves around a circular track on the game board, enabling you to buy or build only where this master builder is located.

The game begins with a drafting session in which you purchase units (soldiers, knights, camps and catapults) and bid on special abilities that will enhance your income, attack, or other options in the game. The game is then played over four turns (seasons), and in each turn players simultaneously choose one of three potential actions: (a) tax, (b) build new units, or (c) move and attack. Each turn ends with players collecting income. To attack, you move your unit into an occupied area, then secretly decide how much gold you will spend to motivate your troops. The defender then has to guess how much you have spent. If the defender guesses wrong, the attack succeeds; if the defender is correct, the attack fails and you lose your unit. Regardless of success you have spent your gold, so the tight trade-off that players have to assess is whether to be cheap with your men so that you can conserve gold for future builds and attacks, or be generous to increase your chances now but limit future options. The different abilities available in each game make for varied strategies and strong replayability as no two games are alike. After the initial strategic planning stage, Melee is fast and highly interactive. Beware as the game can end suddenly with a bold attack on an inadequately defended castle, making for a game that can be very nasty, brutish and short.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973013,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/melee?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@400x400.jpg,34.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scientists programmed each of these Worlds with an individual set of laws and rules which the residents strictly follow and consider most important for their lives. These may be exploration, consumption, economics, military, etc., and each is unique. You can visit all of these 504 alternate Earths to experience how the people are living, and decide which of these worlds harbors the best civilization. On which World do you want to live? Explore them all and decide! 504 is a game that creates 504 different games out of one box.

(504 = 9 * 8 * 7 = the number of distinct permutations of three items from a set of nine. The order of the three game modules is significant, and modules cannot be repeated.) For example, you can play: a racing game that expands through exploration with technology improving the racing or exploration (World &quot;253&quot;). an 18XX-style stock game with network building for income and production sites to provide workers for the road building (World &quot;968&quot;). a war game with a pick-up and deliver economy and bonus scoring from majorities (&quot;World 417&quot;).

Civil War,Toys &amp; Games &gt; Games &gt; Board Games,"The U.S. Civil War is a 2-player strategic-level war game of the American Civil War. The game covers the entire war from 1861-65 on a large 30&rdquo; x 44&rdquo; map area (2 mounted maps) of the Southeastern United States. Turns represent 3 months during the winter and 2 months during the summer, with four Action Phases to each turn. Military forces are represented by generals and strength-points (SPs). Each SP represents approximately 5,000 soldiers. Game mechanics stress strategy, maneuver and leadership but details like ironclads, naval battles, leader promotions, forts, and commerce raiders are included. Shorter scenarios are included that cover just 1861, 1862 and 1863. Players of Eric Lee Smith&rsquo;s The Civil War (VG) and Mark Herman&rsquo;s For the People (AH and GMT) will see many similarities between this game and those two benchmark games.

Class 1C and 2C come on the same game board with color denoting spaces that can be used in 2C but not in 1C. Asteroids that approach the spaceship from the front or from behind sometimes swoop around to hit the ship on the side, and asteroids that approach from the side sometimes split in half and hit the ship twice! A structural rift down the center of the spaceship requires universal connectors to connect only with other universal connectors when bridging this rift. So much for their universality! Class 3C is a toroidal spaceship with the top of the 6x6 tile grid wrapping around to the bottom and the left side wrapping around to the right. Since lasers require an empty space in front of them &ndash; and engines an empty space behind them &ndash; your ship must have holes in it to accomodate those building requirements, and the larger and more numerous the holes, the more you must pay in insurance costs prior to launching your spaceship. Class 4C has space to build four separate spaceships, but when the sand timer is flipped the first time, someone rolls a die and players can now build in additional areas of the game board in order to connect some of the ships. When the sand timer is flipped a second time, the die is rolled once more, possibly providing additional building sites.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973025,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/galaxy-trucker-latest-models?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973025.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973025@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973025@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973025@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973025@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973025@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973025@400x400.jpg,26.99 AUD,Czech Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,20.24 AUD,,,,,,,,

The Board Game,Toys &amp; Games &gt; Games &gt; Board Games,"M.U.L.E. was first published as a computer game in 1983. Inspired by board games, it became a breakthrough, then a classic. Now this warm-hearted game of cut-throat capitalism is finally available as a board game!&nbsp;In M.U.L.E. The Board Game, you are one of the pioneering and industrious species of a Galactic Federation. Together with your fellow colonists, you attempt to settle the distant Planet Irata with the so-called help of a mule-like machine you all learn to hate. But for now, he&#39;s all you&#39;ve got. Well, him and your fellow colonists. I wouldn&#39;t count on their help, though &mdash; not unless there&#39;s profit. Good luck. You&#39;ll need it.&nbsp;In M.U.L.E. (abbreviated from &ldquo;Multiple Use Labor Element&rdquo;), players claim plots of land and install mechanical robots (M.U.L.E.s) to work on them. M.U.L.E.s produce goods that colonists can use, sell for profit or stockpile for (hopefully) even more profit:&nbsp; Smithore is a metal that cannot be used by players directly, but can be sold to The Store. The Store uses Smithore to manufacture M.U.L.E.s. Since players need M.U.L.E.s to produce their Goods, they must sell Smithore to increase their production. Crystite is a luxury mineral with a highly volatile price. It is not needed for anything on Planet Irata, but can be exported to other worlds for great profits (unless stolen by Pirates &ndash; you have been warned!) Food is needed by players to take Development Actions, such as Assaying Lands or Installing/Refitting M.U.L.E.s. Energy is needed to power M.U.L.E.s. You&#39;ll know the value of Energy when you lack it. &nbsp;There will be unexpected surpluses and shortages of different goods, causing market prices to fluctuate. Players must plan ahead while maintaining flexibility to change their plans as all kinds &rdquo;fun&rdquo; planetary disasters hit them. Interaction between colonists is highly opportunistic: they will gladly help you if there&#39;s profit in it for them. Or maybe not. You&#39;ll get to see the true color of your friends by playing M.U.L.E. with them. The most cunning settler and trader receives fame, fortune, and the honorary title of First Founder! There is also an overall Colony Retirement score, describing how your colony succeeded (or failed) as a whole.

Through Chicanery, Seren is allowed to draw 1 Resource card from the Seasons Resources at the beginning of each of her turns, and she can choose from any of the four types (Armory, Tavern, Market or Sorcery). This ability frees her up from visiting the Citadel&#39;s buildings as frequently as other Heroes, and gives the Heroes a way to get at least one Resource card per turn. Note that unlike Kador&#39;s Archmastery or Orobox&#39;s Intimidation skills, Seren may only draw from the Season Resources, which drains from the Heroes&#39; common resources and makes her options limited if the Season resource decks are depleted.&nbsp;Axel, the Engineer As an Engineer, Axel comes with the Royal Artilleryman starting Special Ability. With it, Axel gets a free action per turn to either Rotate or Shoot the Catapult, and it can help the Heroes in crucial moments! Each Catapult shot may kill up to three enemies and it has a Strength of 4, so it can kill M&ouml;lens or severely damage the Avatar! The option to rotate the catapult is also important because Axel may use it to aim the catapult for another Hero, allowing him or her to shoot twice with the catapult in their turn if they wish to do so!&nbsp;Eyra, the Thief Last, but not least, Eyra the Thief brings two starting Special Abilities that emphasize her roguish nature: Filch and Archer&#39;s Discipline. With Filch, Eyra &quot;accidentally comes by&quot; one Market resource card at the beginning of each of her turns. These Tavern Resource cards come directly from the Tavern Resource pool, so she may get a card even if the Tavern is damaged or destroyed.

The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world. Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions. In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter. Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently. When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area. Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track.

Selecting the actions is simple, but when one bird flies, so do all the others! Can you time your actions to take advantage of when the flocks fly?&nbsp; During the game Flock, players try to expand their flock with the goal of scoring the most victory points after three rounds of play. Victory points are scored by controlling the action cards at the end of each round. Also, be sure to have enough tasty worms to feed your birds at the end of each round, or otherwise they will fly away. Will your flock be on top of the pecking order?&nbsp; In more detail, players start with three of their eleven birds in front of them. Six nest, egg and worm tokens are placed on the side for each player. On a turn, a player can either place a bird on one of the six action cards or activate an action card on which they have at least one bird. When you activate an action card, you can remove birds from the card &mdash; possibly paying worms, nests and eggs as well &mdash; to take the action shown, such as removing two birds from &quot;Feeding&quot; to get three worms. Spent birds are returned to your personal pool of resources, while other spent resources are placed on the side. Each player in turn order does the same with this action, then whether they used their birds or not, all birds are removed from this action card, flying away to the players&#39; personal pools. &nbsp; When the &quot;Dominance&quot; card is activated, the dominant player adjusts their pecking order on the initiative track, then everyone else flies their birds from that card to the other action cards. When &quot;Competition&quot; is activated, which is possible only when enough birds have landed on it, each player spends a nest and worm for each of their birds (removing them if this isn&#39;t possible), then flies their birds to other action cards.

In more detail, players take their first two turns to place their korrigans on the game board; with each korrigan you place, you look at the tokens in that location and keep one of them.

From the third turn on, players use their animal tokens to move their korrigans and pick up more tokens. Each round the player holding the bag draws a rainbow token and places it in one of the rows or columns on the board; this means that the pot of gold won&#39;t appear in this row or column in the final part of the game. Once the gold is finally placed on the game board, players have a final round in which they try to reach the pot with their korrigans.

On a turn, a player either rests (gaining money and repairing their ship) or else travels (paying to do so), battles (either starships, planets or opponents), and optionally takes the &quot;tour of pirates&quot;, visiting one of the ten planets in the game and taken the action available there. Each player holds two trophy cards, and when they meet the conditions on one of them, they can reveal it to earn credits, glory or both. They can gain support (single-use cards) and equipment (providing power adjustments and possibly other special abilities), keeping at most four of these improvement cards at a time. Players can negotiate alliances and trade anything but glory, and while they must keep their word for immediate exchanges and actions, they can break promises or alliances in later turns, although doing so requires them to suffer the &quot;judgement of pirates&quot;, thereby affecting their glory count. Collect four such points, and they can no longer ally with other players or give or receive assistance. When a player has nine or more glory points or the space deck contains two or fewer cards, the game ends and whoever has the most glory wins.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973060,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-board-games/metal-adventures?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973060.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973060@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973060@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973060@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973060@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973060@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973060@400x400.jpg,59.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cards are full of quotes both from history and from famous Napoleonic movies: &ldquo;By God, sir, I have lost my leg. &ndash; By God, sir, so you have.&rdquo; or &ldquo;We shall match them with our lancers!&rdquo; Nobody can resist reading these with the right accent&hellip; The challenge You win the game by destroying half the total combat strength of the enemy army.

Instead of AI units being individually programmed as in past games, AI units utilize a unique emergent behavior and agent-based logic. Each situation is evaluated and the AI implements the best course of action using available resources and unit assets. Even veteran CoH players will be challenged to hone and adapt their playing styles in order to overcome the AI! In the Conflict of Heroes Solo System, players no longer track APs, but must make a Unit Spent Check after every action. The higher the cost in APs an action was, the higher the probability that the unit will be spent. Now a player must decide if he will augment his action with APs or increase his chance of keeping the unit fresh! Each Firefight has its own Mission Track. A Mission Track is a series of events that are triggered if the Mission Marker lands on an event&#39;s space. Certain orders advance the Mission Marker 1, 2 or 3 spaces, so the game is different each time you play. The firefight ends immediately when the Mission Marker lands on or passes the last space of the Mission Track.

Players create their own menagerie of up to six creatures, each of which is represented by up to six cards, by using cards to introduce, multiply, evolve, and adapt their creatures. Each of the 162 unique cards identifies a creature&#39;s class, a continent and terrain that the creature inhabits, and a special or scoring ability. Each class of creature is also represented by a counter, and the cards are also used to trigger the movement of the counters along the trails on the boards and by migrating, from one board to another. Breeding, achieved by flipping over a creature&#39;s counter, generates new cards. Movement facilitates further breeding and the chance to secure tokens for additional icons and point scoring. At the end of the game, points are scored through abilities on the creature&#39;s cards, the position of the creatures&#39; counters on the boards, and from tokens; the player with the most points wins.

To set up, fill the board with all the pawns, placed at random. Before starting the game, each player can exchange their Emperor pawn with another of their pawns elsewhere on the board. On your turn, you must do both phases in this order: the action phase, then the reinforcements phase. During the action phase, you must perform one single action: Move: Move to an empty space, regroup or attack; you can attack only a stack of enemy pieces that contains strictly fewer pieces than the attacking stack &mdash; except that a stack of four pieces can be attacked and destroyed by a stack of one piece. Construct: You can construct only one building per space; subsequent construction on the same space replaces the existing building. Each terrain type allows specific types of construction. In order to construct a building on an empty space or on a space already containing one of your buildings, you must sacrifice pieces from a single stack adjacent to this construction space. Once per turn, you can take an extra action by sacrificing three stackable pieces. A stack that contains the Emperor can attack an enemy stack even if it contains an equal number of pieces, and even if it contains another Emperor. Each enemy Emperor you have captive is worth 3 VP. During the reinforcements phase, if you have pieces in your reserve, you must return at least one piece to play if you can. You can place up to three pieces onto a single stack of your color on the board (never on an empty space), respecting the following rule: You cannot place reinforcements on a stack if it is adjacent to another player&#39;s building.

A player owns a square if it is covered by a Megalith showing his color on the upper face. A Dolmen is a group of at least three adjacent squares belonging to the same player. The game is won by the player with the most Dolmens; in case of a tie, the player with the largest Dolmen wins.

Sail until the sea falls off the edge of the world!]&nbsp;SeaFall is a &lsquo;Legacy&rsquo; board game designed by board game industry veteran Rob Daviau. A Legacy game is a concept developed by Rob. The idea behind a Legacy game is that the game &lsquo;remembers&rsquo;.

Players will watch as their actions have permanent effects on the game world.&nbsp;SeaFall is the third Legacy game designed by Rob Daviau. It was preceded by Risk Legacy and Pandemic Legacy Season 1. Both were important and very successful games that sent ripples through the board game community for their innovation and scope. Now, for the first time ever, instead of adding Legacy mechanics to an existing game, Rob has built a world and game around the Legacy idea.&nbsp; Designer: Rob Daviau Ages 14+ Players 3 - 5 90 - 120 minutes",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973085,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/seafall?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973085.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973085@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973085@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973085@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973085@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973085@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973085@400x400.jpg,117.99 AUD,PLAID HAT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the game, foragers pick fruit from trees, fish in lakes, and hunt aurochs in the fields. After collecting these foods, the foragers return to a fire pit, where they &quot;share&quot; their food with the tribe and earn victory points. In addition, the foragers sometimes happen upon tools, which allow them to forage, fish, or hunt more efficiently. Of course, foragers are not completely altruistic and so they occasionally fight with each other to earn respect. The player who can best optimize their food and tool gathering, while also avoiding or winning skirmishes is the one who eventually earns the tribe leader title. The game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, depending upon the number of players. In each round, all players simultaneously choose an action card, from a hand of 3 action cards (drawn from a deck of 10) to use for that round. Each action card lists 5 different actions, but a player may only use 4 of those actions each round. Then, in clockwise order, each player performs 1 of the actions on their card until all players have performed 4 actions. Such actions include things like: walking, foraging, eating, discovering, resting, sharing, and picking up a tool. When players pick up food, they place it on their tableau, which tracks the food&#39;s freshness. At the end of each round, a &quot;spoilage card&quot; is flipped and all players &quot;age&quot; their food (i.e., move them along a food track). As the food gets older, it does not provide as much energy if eaten. Also, to score victory points, players must &quot;share&quot; their food before it spoils. In this sense, the players are racing not only against each other, but against nature.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973096,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/foragers?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@400x400.jpg,52.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The king&#39;s power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of meeples) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner. In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply). A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo&mdash;a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king&#39;s pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king&#39;s region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round. The goal is to have a majority of caballeros in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any meeples you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large meeple) and in the region containing the king.

They ran into Australian infantrymen of the 39th Militia Battalion, starting a three-month campaign waged in some of the world&#39;s most forbidding terrain. An Australian militia brigade went up the trail to face the Japanese, who poured in reinforcements of their own. Next the veteran Australian 7th Infantry Division, the heroes of Tobruk, plunged into the jungles and finally stopped the Japanese attacks. While Australian soldiers fought on despite rampant malaria, Japanese troops hauled artillery shells over the mountains by hand and resorted to eating Australian prisoners of war. Finally in September 1942 the Japanese withdrew from one of the war&#39;s most brutal campaigns. The Kokoda Campaign is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series. Based on these battles, it includes the two maps that appeared in our old Kokoda Trail book and 428 playing pieces that originally appeared in our out-of-print Guadalcanal and Afrika Korps games.

The British dispersed their strength to hold the city, reduce Colonial forts along the Delaware River, and watch the Americans, who hovered nearby. Washington saw an opportunity to attack the weakened British main body at Germantown. The multi-prong American plan fell apart in dense fog, but a few breaks going their way would have endangered the British position in eastern Pennsylvania. Germantown uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973148,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/germantown-washinton-strikes-mini-game-series?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973148.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973148@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973148@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973148@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973148@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973148@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973148@400x400.jpg,22.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Opposing these lads are elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; (Hitler Youth) and Panzer Lehr&mdash;elite panzergrenadier units. The goal of the British division is to seize the town of Fontenay, then press onward to secure the high ground near Rauray in time for the impending Operation Epsom, to be launched the next morning. &nbsp; The game by designer Mark Mokszycki uses the same system as Red Winter, his game on the Battle of Tolvaj&auml;rvi from the Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939. Scale is grand tactical: 90 minutes per game turn, 425 yards per hex, and mostly company sized infantry units with platoon sized armor units. Gone are the Winter War specific rules such as ski movement and night raids, and in their place we have a more detailed armor/anti-tank subsystem. There are lots of tanks on both sides in this one!&nbsp; Rules for Operation Dauntless include the 12th SS Fanatical Defense Table, British sabot ammo, tank destroyers, self-propelled infantry guns and artillery, combat engineers, troop transport, British air strikes, German nuisance raids (night bombings), infantry anti-tank weapons, German ammo shortage, and abstracted effects of the immense British opening barrage by 650 guns. Terrain is a mixture of corn and wheat fields, orchards, woods, heavy and light bocage, and small stone farm houses and villages. The Germans begin the game dug in, and they may place a limited number of fortifications during setup. &nbsp; The game includes a multi-day campaign as well as several shorter scenarios. The Germans are on the defensive overall, but they are armed to the teeth with many powerful panzer formations&mdash;including Panzer IVs, Panthers, and Tigers&mdash;and will find themselves able to counterattack frequently and effectively. Some of the shorter scenarios feature the Germans on the offensive to recapture lost ground. &nbsp; The game was designed for two players, but works very well solitaire. &nbsp; Game Scale: Turn: 90 minutes Map: 425 yards per hex Unit: Platoon to Company&nbsp; Game Contents: Three counter sheets of 528 5/8&quot; counters (roughly 2 sheets of unit counters and 1 sheet of markers) One 22 x 34&quot; map One 36 page Rule Book One 28 page Play Book (includes full-color illustrated examples of play, Comparisons to Red Winter, Tips &amp; Strategies, and counter manifest) One 56 page Scenario Book (includes 11 tutorials, ~15 scenarios, and optional rules) One 48 page Reference Book (includes designer&#39;s notes and complete Order of Battle) Two Identical Player Aid Cards (foldout, 4 sided) One Player Air Card 2 (Optional rules)(1 sided) One British Reinforcement Card (8.5 x 11&quot;, 1 sided) One German Reinforcement Card (11 x 17&quot;, 1 sided) One Flowchart card (double-sided with LOS and Armor Reaction Cycle aids) One Campaign Game Setup &amp; Vehicle Identification Card (2 sided) One Turn Track Card (Turn Track A: June 16-18 on front, Turn Track B: June 25-27 on back) One Information &amp; Turn Phase Track Card (1 sided) One Tutorial Getting Started #1: Infantry Card (2 sided) One Tutorial Getting Started #2: Armor Card (2 sided) Three 6-sided dice Three 10-sided dice&nbsp; Complexity: Medium (similar to Red Winter or a tad more complex) Solitaire Suitability: High&nbsp; Players 2 Playing time 120 minutes Suggested ages 14",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973173,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/operation-dauntless-the-battles-for-fontenay-and-rauray-france-june-1944?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973173.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973173@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973173@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973173@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973173@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973173@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973173@400x400.jpg,86.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acting as organizers of the fair, players work diligently to increase their influence throughout the fair and obtain the grand exhibits that will be put on display. The organizer who has earned the best reputation when the fair begins will emerge the victor.&nbsp;On each turn of World&#39;s Fair 1893, the active player sends a supporter to one of the five areas and gather all of the cards by it. New cards are then added to some of the areas, and the next player takes a turn.&nbsp;The five areas represent sections of exhibits, like Fine Arts and Electricity. Some cards represent exhibit proposals in one of those five areas, others represent influential people who give you bonus supporters, and other cards represent tickets for attractions and concessions along the Midway.&nbsp;The game consists of three scoring rounds, each triggered when players collectively gather a certain number of Midway tickets.

The only way you can win is by tracking down Ariad and defeating her in battle before another hero can reach her!&nbsp;Along the way, you&rsquo;ll find yourself face-to-face with new and hideous monsters or terrifying perils. You may encounter an Arachyura , a spider-like creature that can trap you in its webs and deal lingering damage even after it&rsquo;s defeated.

Taking on the roles of Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, Rock Lee, Sai and Shikamaru from the Hidden Leaf Village, players attempt to stop the Akatsuki from extracting the tailed beasts from their bearers and using them to power their ultimate weapon: The Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;. &nbsp; In more detail, the Akatsuki start at one of the nine villages on the game board, spend at most three turns in that village, then (if they&#39;re not defeated there) move to the next village. Each Akatsuki character has its own strengths and weaknesses. The villages are distant from one another, so players can&#39;t race from one village to another after them, but must divide their forces to prepare for conflict, encountering unexpected events along the way. &nbsp; Each player has a character card showing Combat Ability, Chakra Reserve, and Strategy Value, as well as an experience track that allows them to power up over time. Each character also has a deck of fourteen ability cards, some common to each deck but most unique to that character. &nbsp; Each turn a character takes two actions from move, meditate, or fight. When you fight, you roll dice, hoping for shuriken. You can play cards to increase the number of dice you roll, but you must spend Chakra to play them and both cards and Chakra are limited. The enemy fights back if you don&#39;t deal enough damage to it, possibly triggering special powers and additional effects in the process. &nbsp; Once the Akatsuki arrive at Hidden Leaf Village, players must face Tobi and the Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;, with their power being greater for each tailed beast that they stole on their way to this final showdown. &nbsp; Naruto Shippuden: The Board Game features three levels of play and a large variety of enemies, making each game a unique experience. &nbsp; Ages 13 Playing time 60 minutes Players 2-5",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973252,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/naruto-shippuden-the-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@400x400.jpg,78.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns). Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds). The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.&nbsp;From the Box: The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour! The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they&#39;ve created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.&nbsp;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)&nbsp;Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.&nbsp;Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.&nbsp;Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port).

The operation, however, hung on a slender thread: the lone supply line for the breakout ran through Avranches. Hitler and his generals recognized the weakness; the generals thought the German army in Normandy lacked the strength to take Avranches, but Hitler ordered the attack. Four panzer divisions were gathered near the ancient village of Mortain, intending to take the town and the nearby Hill 317 before driving west. In their way stood the US 30th Infantry Division. The Germans needed a rapid breakthrough, while the Americans had to buy time for reinforcements to arrive. Mortain Counterattack uses the Fire &amp; Movement system designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers.

Unfortunately you can&#39;t just grab them for yourself as everyone in the neighborhood wants to claim those adorable kitties. Outwit your fellow feline fiends as you lure cats onto your property, move cats into your house, and steal cats from your neighbors. All&#39;s fair in love and cat-collecting!&nbsp; In the game, each player chooses a Property board, which contains three zones: the Yard, the Porch, and the House. At the end of the game, cats in the House are worth 5 points each, cats on the Porch are worth 3 points each, and cats in your Yard are worth 0 points. However, having cats in your Yard does have advantages for special scoring conditions, such as having the most cats of a single color or the most cats overall. All 40 cat miniatures are placed in the center of the table, and represent the Neighborhood. Each player is dealt 2 or 3 cards, depending on the number of players in the game. &nbsp; On each player&#39;s turn, they perform two Actions: moving a cat, playing a card, or discarding cards. Cats can be moved 1 space for 1 Action, by picking up the cat and putting it in the next zone of the property. For example, a cat can be moved from the Neighborhood to the Yard for 1 Action, or from the Yard to the Porch or from the Porch to the Yard (and vice versa). Playing cards may allow a player to move multiple cats at once, to move cats multiple spaces, to steal cats from opponents, or to make opponents give up cats. A player may also choose to discard 1, 2, or 3 cards as an Action. Once both Actions have been taken, the player draws back up to a full hand, and play passes to the person to the left. If an Instant card (red border) is drawn, it is played immediately and affects the entire group. The player then draws a replacement card for the Instant card until a full hand is achieved. &nbsp; The final round is triggered when a player draws the last card from the draw pile. From that point every player, including the player who drew the last card, has one final turn to maximize their score. Then, the cats are counted and a winner is lauded for their purr-procurement proficiency. &nbsp; Age 10 Playing time 30 minutes Players 3-6",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973284,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/here-kitty-kitty?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973284.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973284@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973284@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973284@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973284@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973284@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973284@400x400.jpg,38.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coins are scored for gem tiles on the mines you have claimed, with bonuses for dynamite tiles &mdash; but if there is too much dynamite, the mine (and all the riches within) are destroyed!&nbsp; In more detail, players sit around a circle composed of cave game boards and the guildhall game board, with sixty mining tiles placed face-down within this circle. Each round, while playing at the same time, players use one hand to look at one mining tile at a time, then place it on one of the cave game boards. At any time, a player can claim the guildhall or a cave by placing one of their three goblins on the board, after which no more tiles or goblins may be placed on this board. &nbsp; Once everyone has placed all of their goblins (or decided not to place them), players resolve the boards. The goblin on the guildhall draws a minion card that provides a special ability, while each goblin in a cave scores coins based on the gems, diamonds, dynamite and monsters found there; these goblins can also take minion cards if minion tiles have been placed in the cave. Dynamite multiplies the value of a cave, but three or more sticks blows the place up, costing you coins. &nbsp; If someone has one hundred or more coins, the game ends and whoever has the most coins wins; if not, set up another round and go digging again. &nbsp; Ages 14 Playing time 25-35 minutes Players 2-4",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973285,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/greedy-greedy-goblins?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973285.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973285@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973285@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973285@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973285@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973285@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973285@400x400.jpg,58.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The British reformed near El Alamein, just 90 miles from Alexandria. After the repulse of a hasty attack in mid-July, Rommel orchestrated a more careful assault for the end of the month. His mobile troops were to swing wide into the desert to flank the British line and unhinge it. Eighth Army was waiting, forewarned by ULTRA intercepts. Its new commander, Bernard Mongomery, arrayed his armor along the ridge of Alam el Halfa. The German assault would pit the tactical finesse of Afrika Korps against greater numbers of tanks and guns.

Initial cat moves are only one space, but become two spaces after once around the track, so when the cat speeds up, the game is almost all over!&nbsp; Viva Topo! is a family game that has players balancing risk and rewards as they attempt to outrun the cat and score for cheese. &nbsp; AWARDS &amp; HONORS 2012 Lys Enfant Finalist 2009 Boardgames Australia Awards Best Children&#39;s Game Winner 2009 Boardgames Australia Awards Best Children&#39;s Game Nominee 2003 Spiel des Jahres Kinderspiel Winner 2003 Spiel des Jahres Kinderspiel Nominee 2003 Spiel der Spiele Hit f&uuml;r Kinder Recommended 2003 Kinderspielexperten &quot;5-to-9-year-olds&quot; Third Place 2003 Kinderspielexperten &quot;5-to-9-year-olds&quot; Nominee 2003 Japan Boardgame Prize Best Childgame Winner&nbsp; Ages 4 Playing time 20-30 minutes Players 2-4",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973292,http://www.ozgameshop.com/childrens-board-games/viva-topo?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973292.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973292@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973292@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973292@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973292@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973292@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973292@400x400.jpg,42.99 AUD,Pegasus Spiele,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The three new Dragon Generals (Onyx - black, Hemlock - green, Brimstone - red) can be used with Sapphire, the original blue Dragon, in a struggle that will severely test the mettle of the Heroes of the Realm. The new General card for Sapphire gives her an additional hit point for each other Dragon in play. &nbsp; You can also mix and match the new Generals with the existing Generals. The new Generals minions&#39; each have their own special abilities: Onyx&#39;s (black) Zealots go berserk when fighting - the survivors together dealing one point of damage after each combat action. You&#39;ll still take a wound from each if you remain in the same area with them at the end of your turn. Hemlock&#39;s (green) Imps propagate quickly (whenever you place an Imp, another one pops up in every adjacent space) and steal a random card from you if you remain in the same space with them at the end of your turn. Brimstone&#39;s (red) Fire Elementals spontaneously combust whenever three of them get together, setting the area on fire. Areas on fire require 2 Actions to move into, taint whenever three minions are present, instead of 4 and deal wounds to Heroes remaining in the area at the end of their turns. The Generals each have their own special nastiness as well. For example, Brimstone, instead of moving along the usual red-General path, moves every time her card comes up when Darkness Spreads, flitting here and there and setting the world on fire. Players can lose cards when attacking Hemlock. &nbsp; Any of the new dragons can also be used as an Agent of the Dark Lord when playing with at least one of the original Generals (Varkolak, Gorgut, or Balazarg). You can add up to 5 of the 10 Global Effects Cards (5 Good, 5 Bad) to the Darkness Spreads deck to adjust the toughness of your campaign. Likewise, a number of Royal Blessing Tokens (4 max) can also be added to the game. Royal Blessings allow players to either ignore a Darkness Spreads card, remove a taint crystal or prevent a General from moving. &nbsp; For a more Campaign-style game, players can utilize the King&#39;s Champion Scoring Variant which allows players to track their feats, major and minor. Feat examples include: taking on 3 minions at once, killing two with one blow, attempting to complete a quest, successfully completing a quest, healing the land, putting out a fire, dealing wounds or the killing blow to a General... The player with the most fame at the end of the game becomes the King&#39;s Champion. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th most famous Heroes also receive titles and awards. The titles and awards each provide a special ability to that character that can be utilized the next time it is played by the same player. &nbsp; Scheduled to debut at Spiel 2010 is the Dragon Expansion (formerly the Black Dragon expansion), which consists of the following:&nbsp; 3 General Miniatures (3 Dragons)&nbsp; 3 New General Cards 1 New Sapphire (Blue Dragon) General Card 4 Wound Tokens 1 for each General&nbsp; 3 Agents of the Dark Lord Cards 10 Fire Tokens&nbsp; 4 Royal Blessing Tokens 1 Royal Blessing Card&nbsp; 12 New Quest Cards 10 Global Effects Cards&nbsp; 1 Fame Card 6 New Special Cards&nbsp; New Darkness Spreads Deck New Hero Cards Deck&nbsp; King&rsquo;s Champion Variant Scoring Tokens&nbsp; 7 Kings Champion Reward Cards Rulebook and A Story from the Realm&nbsp; Ages 13 Playing time 90 minutes Players 1-6",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973297,http://www.ozgameshop.com/board-game-expansions/defenders-of-the-realm-dragon-expansion-2nd-edition?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973297.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973297@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973297@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973297@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973297@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973297@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973297@400x400.jpg,98.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&nbsp;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction&#39;s stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&nbsp;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&nbsp;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&nbsp;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&nbsp;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973304,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/scythe?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@400x400.jpg,199.99 AUD,Stonemaier Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nathaniel Banks led a small army up Louisiana&#39;s Red River. His objective, in conjunction with an overland campaign through Arkansas, was the Confederate Trans-Mississippi capital at Shreveport. Poor coordination of the two columns enabled the Confederates to concentrate their slender resources against each in turn.

Historically, the Union forces, strung out on the march, were routed piecemeal, but the battle could have gone the other way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mansfield uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era.

In an attempt to break through American defenses to reach Albany, New York, Burgoyne launched his army at the American defenses on Bemis Heights. An American screen dispatched by Benedict Arnold clashed with the British advance in deep woods, triggering an afternoon-long fight fed by reinforcements for both sides. The battle ended in stalemate, as good as a defeat for Burgoyne, but might have tipped in his favor. &nbsp; Saratoga uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era.

Will the investigative team be able to find out the criminal only from these elements?In Unusual Suspects, one player is the Witness and the other players play the part of the Investigative Team. The Witness knows the real identity of the Guilty and tries to make the Team hit it only with his answers. The Team asks questions to the Witness and, depending on his answers, will exclude the innocent suspects after players have discussed what they learned.Unusual Suspects can also be played competitively or collaboratively (team vs team). In the latter case, a grid of twelve suspects is created. Every round the team reveals a question card and the Witness has to answer yes/no.

When you send an inventor to work you apply that character&#39;s skills &mdash; Albert Einstein has a starting skill of four Physics, for example, while Johannes Gutenberg has a starting skill of two Mechanics &mdash; against the needs of the invention, marking off what you&#39;ve done with colored cubes.&nbsp;When an invention is complete, the three players who have contributed the most reap the rewards of its completion!

From the ashes of a devastating third World War, a precious few golden cities emerge offering hope to those who struggle for survival in the wastelands. Players explore the ruins of the modern world completing quests, honing their skills and maneuvering for social status in order to claim a precious spot as a citizen with a Golden City. To enter the golden city you must:&nbsp; Become an expert: Reach 20 skill points. Serve the city: Fulfill three secret quests. Become a nobleman: Get the most possible character points. In each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill &mdash; mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic &mdash; and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources. &nbsp; The board of the game is modular so that in every game you have a new map to discover. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. When raiding a building, you get resources (tools, scraps, mechanics, electronics, etc.). By combining these resources, you can craft items with special abilities. By doing so, you will advance your skill points. &nbsp; Every player also gets secret quests of the golden city. To fulfill these quests, the players have to spend the resources mentioned on the card. To fulfill a quest will not only lead the players closer to victory but also give them advantages for the rest of the game. &nbsp; Players 3-5 Playing time 90 minutes Ages 12",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973347,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/raid-and-trade?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973347.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973347@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973347@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973347@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973347@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973347@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973347@400x400.jpg,82.49 AUD,Nina,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Negotiate, bluff, forge alliances, threaten your rivals &mdash; use every tool at your disposal to spread your influence, establish supremacy, and claim the ultimate prize: the Iron Throne!&nbsp;In more detail, each turn centers around the resolution of an encounter between two players. These encounters can result in hostilities, startling conquests, and the spread of influence, or they can result in the formation of temporary alliances. And though only two players in any encounter will be the &quot;active&quot; players, your friends might offer you their support &mdash; or turn around and offer it to someone else.&nbsp;The encounters of The Iron Throne resolve quickly, but they are full of opportunities for cunning strategy, devious intrigues, and brokered alliances. Each features a challenger and a defender, and after these players assign characters to resolve the encounter on the behalf of their Houses, other players may offer their support to either side. In this way, an encounter that starts as a contest between the Lannisters and the Starks may escalate and draw in the support of the Tyrells or other Houses.&nbsp;However, there&#39;s more to the encounters of The Iron Throne than this initial jostling for power, even with all the alliances and betrayals it can entail. There are still schemes within schemes, and the bluffs, negotiations, and hidden information that color these encounters as the active players discuss the House cards they intend to play. Of course, there&#39;s a very good chance that one or both of them may be lying, but they can offer and even agree to a truce. Or they can bid cards from their hands, hoping to win hostilities with the higher total power.&nbsp;In the event of a truce, the active players discuss what they may give each other in order to maintain the peace. In the event of hostilities, however, one side will win, and the other will suffer. You might seize influence or take hostages, or you may even have your characters put to the sword.&nbsp;Win enough of these encounters, though &mdash; and find the right ones to lose &mdash; and you might find yourself in position to seize the Iron Throne. The goal of the game is to spread five of your influence to your opponents&#39; House cards and take the crown for yourself.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973354,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/game-of-thrones-hbo-the-iron-throne?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@400x400.jpg,81.99 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you&#39;ll find on a farm: collecting resources; building meadows; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&nbsp; Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two meeples that can each take an action per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you&#39;ll have more: each round a (fixed) additional option becomes available. Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it&#39;s important to do some things with high preference. &nbsp; In comparison with the family game of the predecessor, much has changed: the new action each round is fixed, and the game has been simplified by removing stone and vegetables. Similar to Agricola: Die Bauern und das liebe Vieh, there are now buildings (replacing the major improvements) that score points for leftover resources at the end of the game.&nbsp; Also, there are no building restrictions (nor player boards).

In the center of the once great citadel stands a stone temple. Local legends tell of great treasures that lie buried beneath the temple, but despite many weeks of searching no doorway has been found. &nbsp; On the top of the temple stands a square stone altar. A small totem stands in the center of this, surrounded by a pattern of sixteen carved tiles. Examining them closely you discover an intricate series of mechanisms which allow the tiles to switch places and turn over, which reveals that each tile has a stone side and a gold side. Carvings on each side of the pillar indicate that a sequence of four key patterns must be made with the tiles to open the temple. Can you be the first to unlock the secrets of Codinca?&nbsp; In Codinca, each player has control of a set of four matching symbol tiles: Air, Water, Earth or Fire. Players take turns attempting to move their tiles into a series of four specific key patterns indicated on the key discs drawn at the beginning of the game; those patterns are a block of four, a line of four, four corners (can be four corners of any nine tiles as well as outside corners) and a diagonal line of four.&nbsp; On each turn a player must either switch and flip one of their own tiles with any adjacent tile, or switch one of their tiles with any adjacent tile and switch the same or another of their tiles with any adjacent tiles or flip two tiles, one of which must be one of their own tiles. In addition, players are allocated three Spirit Card that gives them the bonus move choice of Line Push or Rotate Four. This allows players to disguise their planned moves. On the back of the Spirt Card is a Trap Pattern. This can be used to change a set display of tiles from gold to stone and visa versa to match the pattern on the Trap Pattern. Players can match their required patterns in any order, and the first player to match all patterns wins. &nbsp; Players 2-4 Playing time 30 minutes Ages 8",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973365,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/codinca?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@400x400.jpg,25.99 AUD,Black Spindle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, sixteen brand-new plastic figures offer new warriors and heroes for the Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries, even as new Command cards, Deployment cards, Agenda cards, and Class cards give you countless ways to customize your game.

It&rsquo;s called Scrawl and it&rsquo;s about doodling your way to disaster.&nbsp;Each player is given a clipboard, a stack of whiteboard paper and a very questionable Scenario Card (&ldquo;Octopus Mating Season&rdquo;, for example). Each player would then have to do their best at illustrating their scenario before passing it to the player on their left. This player, having no idea what the original Scenario was, clips another page over it and attempts to describe the picture underneath. The clipboards are then passed along once more, with the next player attempting to illustrate the new description in front of them. This continues until each of the clipboards have returned to their original owners.&nbsp;Once the contents of the clipboards are displayed for all to see, players vote for their favourites in a run (most grins wins). Trust us, you&rsquo;ll be amazed at how &ldquo;Octopus Mating Season&rdquo; turned into &ldquo;Cat Orgy&rdquo; so easily. Contains 240 different Scenarios.

War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers. The Europeans, meanwhile, also busily fought each other. &nbsp; Indian Empires is a complete game, using the same game engine as Soldier Emperor, our strategic game of the Napoleonic Wars. It can be played separately, or together with Soldier Emperor; our Dreams of Empire book includes a linking map and the rules and pieces for its use. &nbsp; Indian Empires is a new edition of our long out-of print Soldier Raj. It includes over a dozen scenarios from Hyder Ali&#39;s defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain&#39;s final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France&#39;s Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies. &nbsp; The playing pieces are decadently thick tiles; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are original works of art by Terry Moore Strickland. As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory. &nbsp; As in Soldier Emperor, players command their nation&#39;s military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas. &nbsp; Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe. Players win by taking the most territory, or by destroying their nation&#39;s enemies. &nbsp; Players 1-5 Playing time 120-240 minutes Ages 14",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973385,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/soldier-emperor-indian-empires?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973385.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973385@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973385@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973385@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973385@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973385@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973385@400x400.jpg,66.49 AUD,Avatar Press Inc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Powerful mechanized armies were met by German and Romanian forces along carefully-prepared defensive lines, which initially held off the attacks. But by late summer the Red Army had broken through, and Romania left the Axis to join the Allies in the liberation of Eastern Europe. &nbsp; Broken Axis is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles. You do not need any other game to play any of its 50 scenarios. Design is by Mike Perryman, creator of our Kursk: Burning Tigers game. You can play those scenarios individually, or in one of four &quot;battle games&quot; that link them together for an intense campaign experience. &nbsp; The Germans bring strong armored forces to the party, including Tiger and Panther tanks, Panzer IV medium tanks and the usual array of assault guns. At least that&#39;s what they have when they show up instead of leaving the fighting to the Romanians. The Romanian Army has been rebuilt from its 1941 and 1942 disasters, with German-made tanks and modern Romanian-made anti-tank guns. The Germans do provide the elite Grossdeutschland Division, and its epic stand at Tirgu Frumos is a centerpiece of the game&rsquo;s scenario set. &nbsp; The Red Army is powerful: the new JS-2 heavy tanks are in action, along with the first examples of the T34/85. These are the first large-scale battles fought outside the pre-war borders of the Soviet Union, and the Red Army is eager to take the fight to the Romanian &ldquo;mush eaters.&rdquo;&nbsp; The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too). Plus 517 playing pieces: silky-smooth and die-cut piece, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 50 scenarios with four battle games. &nbsp; Players 1-2 Playing time 30 minutes Ages 12",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973389,http://www.ozgameshop.com/board-game-expansions/panzer-grenadier-broken-axis?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973389.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973389@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973389@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973389@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973389@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973389@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973389@400x400.jpg,98.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can be played both co-operatively or in a one-versus-many setting. It is set during the most explosive days of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, in Budapest, where the fighting was the most fierce. The revolutionary players collect cards and fighters to resolve events and other challenges posed to them by their Soviet opponent (real or simulated). In order to win, they must stay alive throughout the 7 days of fighting - while ensuring that the city doesn&rsquo;t fall.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s 1956 and waves of protests in Poland are once again showing the cracks in the Eastern European communist bloc. Emboldened by these signs, students and intellectuals in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, organise a protest of previously unseen magnitudes. As the communist leadership sweeps in to kill the movement in its tracks, a violent response is provoked, thus sparking the Revolution of the 23rd of October.&nbsp; Ages 13+ Players 1 - 4 90+ minutes",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973416,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/days-of-ire-budapest-1956?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973416.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973416@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973416@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973416@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973416@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973416@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973416@400x400.jpg,105.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gather resources to add buildings with new actions and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don&#39;t forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game. &nbsp; In more detail, over twelve rounds players take turns placing two workers per round, one at a time. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid. &nbsp; Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game&#39;s end. &nbsp; You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the &quot;lay&quot;) must be paid in order to keep the whales selected. &nbsp; After twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.

Eclairs!&quot; The glorious revolution has done away with tyranny! Now you and your friends make up the Revolutionary Committee, overseeing justice throughout the land. Still, now that the queen&#39;s gone, it would be a shame to let all that cake go to waste... &nbsp; Become the first among equals by amassing honour! Become happy by amassing cake! Send your friends&#39; pawns to the guillotine! First to forty cakes wins!&nbsp; Let Them Eat Cake is a game of committees, coercion, and cake. Elect your friends to positions of power in the hope that they look on your patronage favorably &mdash; or denounce them as enemies of the revolution. Alliances and betrayal are all fair game as you try to amass as much cake as you can before the revolution collapses. &nbsp; Each player starts the game with a set of voting cards, three pawns, three medals of honour, and some cake. Each round consists of a series of elections, from the Head of Committee to the Food Inspector. Each vote, after negotiating, bribing, and pleading, is simply a matter of each player secretly choosing a voting card of the player they wish to vote for. Each player&rsquo;s votes are multiplied by the number of pawns they have, and whoever is the Head of Committee will break any ties. Importantly, once you&rsquo;ve used a voting card, you cannot reuse it until you&rsquo;ve played all your cards, demanding shifting allegiances throughout the game. &nbsp; The first vote of the round determines the Head of Committee, the official tie-breaker. Soon thereafter players determine the Enemy of the Revolution, who must place one of their pawns on the guillotine, immediately and potentially permanently reducing their voting power. Next, players elect a Guillotine Operator, who decides whether or not the pawn on the guillotine is executed or spared. Once settled, a Secretary is elected to divvy out cake and generals to the players, one card per player. But before these cards are taken, the players elect a Food Inspector who may, at the cost of a medal, declare all cake unsafe. &nbsp; Throughout the game, players will accumulate medals, generals, and cake. Fewest medals make you the Enemy of the Revolution, but the player with the most Generals is immune to such accusations! Any player can spend their Generals to force a re-election or simply choose the winner of a vote. The game ends when one player reaches 40 or more cakes, a player has their last pawn executed, or the deck runs out. The player with the most cake wins!

Staying on top proves difficult as every stolen die moves other players up the ladder toward taking over as Don, so the tension rises with each shake of the dice. &nbsp; With multiple ways to use each die you roll, players never find themselves at the mercy of the dice, instead using what they roll to make their opponents beg for mercy. &nbsp; Players 3-6 Playing time 45-60 minutes Ages 14",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973437,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/the-godfather-a-new-don?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973437.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973437@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973437@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973437@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973437@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973437@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973437@400x400.jpg,78.49 AUD,IDW Publishing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is even M60A3s sprinkled in to balance out the US tank inventory. Bradley IFVs and CFVs mechanized units are set to take on their counterparts mounted in BMP 1,2s and even a few 3s.

After determining who goes first, players choose the Robot Master&#39;s stage on which they wish to start the game. On your turn, flip over the challenge card to reveal your first challenge. You choose the dice you wish to use to pass the challenge, then play cards from your hand and use abilities from your character to blast, jump or run through the challenge. Your opponents can play cards from the Dr. Wily side of their hand to make your challenge more difficult, possibly doing damage or taking lives from you along the way. If you beat the challenge, you move forward on the stage a number of spaces determined by the challenge you defeated. &nbsp; Once all spaces are clear and you are face-to-face with the Robot Master, you enter the &quot;Boss Battle&quot;. You and your opponents now take turns battling each other until only one robot remains standing. If you are the victor, you take the Robot Master&#39;s powers from the character card, stacking it under your own character card. If you were the first player to defeat this Robot Master, you also gain its Trophy, which allows you to set a die to any face you wish in a future Challenge or Boss Battle. &nbsp; Play continues around the board until you have defeated enough Robot Masters to enter Dr. Wily&#39;s castle and face the final boss.

Seven separate player abilities re-combine each round, depending on the favor of the gods earned that round by each player. For example, earning the favor of the god Ra lets you add a Player Disc to the current Sun for area control around the edges of the board. Ptah allows you to claim the current Monument Card for set collection scoring. Seshat lets you place the current Monument Standee on the board to add to the network of Monuments in play. Geb and Nut let you claim and rotate this Monument Standee and aim it at other Monuments to score points. The Pharaoh lets you secretly contribute cards to the construction of the Pyramid, awarding the greater contributor many points at the end of the game. &nbsp; Over a series of eight rounds, players work to build a Pyramid and a series of smaller monuments to impress the Pharaoh. By performing actions unique to each god, players build monuments and align them to point at other monuments, gaining influence over the Pharaoh as they do so.

Driven by the ambition of their king, the Greeks have arrived on the shores of Troy. Some seek power, some seek revenge, while still others seek the great moment in battle that will define their place in history. &nbsp; Agamemnon is a fast-paced strategy board game in which two players take on the roles of ancient Greek gods during the Trojan War. By tactically deploying warriors to where they&#39;re needed across the board, each player may influence the final outcome of the battles famously detailed in Homer&#39;s Iliad. Some areas will be decided by the strength of the warriors, others by sheer weight of numbers, and some by the inspiration your heroes provide. &nbsp; To begin the game, Strings of Fate tiles are placed on their matching spaces on the board, and each player receives one set of fifteen playing tiles. These tiles come in three varieties: Warriors, with a numerical value marking their strength, Leaders, with both a letter rank and a strength value, and Weavers who have no strength or rank, but instead manipulate the Strings of Fate. Each player will shuffle their tiles face down in front of them. &nbsp; The first player flips over one of their tiles, and places it on any available space. If it&rsquo;s a Weaver, its effect immediately comes into play: the Warp Weaver may swap two adjacent Strings of Fate, whilst the Weft Weaver simply splits all strings it&rsquo;s connected to. After the first turn, each player flips and plays two tiles on their turns. &nbsp; Once all the tiles have been placed, each string is resolved: each Strength String is won by the player with the highest combined strength contained within it; each Leadership String is won by the player with the single highest ranked tile within the string; and Force Strings are won by the player with the most tiles, including Weavers, in the string. Players claim all the tiles from Strings of Fate they have won, and the player with the most tiles at the end wins. &nbsp; Players 2 Playing time 20-30 minutes Ages 12",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973466,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/agamemnon-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@400x400.jpg,29.99 AUD,Osprey Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.99 AUD,,,,,,,,

Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There&#39;s no limit to number of players if you&#39;ve got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he&#39;ll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled. &nbsp; The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle. &nbsp; Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that&#39;s as far as the comparison goes. Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973480,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/take-it-easy?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973480.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973480@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973480@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973480@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973480@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973480@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973480@400x400.jpg,39.99 AUD,Eagle-Gryphon Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This removes that apothecary&#39;s power for the rest of the game, so it&#39;s important for players to keep revealing potions, collecting gems and hiring new apothecaries... all while keeping their opponents at bay!&nbsp; Deduction is key to Apotheca.

Rebels, organized as the Missouri State Guard under Sterling Price, had been joined by a Confederate force under Ben McCulloch to threaten Nathaniel Lyon&#39;s small but well-drilled Union army in the southwestern part of the state. Lyon, hoping to catch the Rebels off guard, attacked their scattered camps along Wilson&#39;s Creek. The initial Union assault went well before the battle devolved into a grueling firefight. Confederate numbers eventually prevailed, but Lyon&#39;s attack might have succeeded. &nbsp; Wilson&#39;s Creek uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful manuever to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973489,http://www.ozgameshop.com/board-game-guides-and-books/wilsons-creek-opening-round-in-the-west?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973489.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973489@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973489@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973489@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973489@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973489@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973489@400x400.jpg,22.99 AUD,Decision Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each player has wine, poison and antidote tokens they can pour into the goblets, trying to poison their enemies while staying alive themselves! Each noble also has a special ability that allows them to bend or even break a rule.&nbsp;In more detail, each character has a plastic goblet, and each goblet is primed in secret at the start of the round with either wine, poison or antidote. On a turn, you take two actions, with actions being to peek inside your goblet, rotate all goblets left or right, swap your goblet with someone else&#39;s, or secretly add one of your wine, poison or antidote tokens to any goblet. Once someone has &quot;served&quot; all of their wine, they can call a toast on their turn instead of doing anything else. Each player, including the toaster, takes one more action, then everyone drinks. If you have more poison than antidote, you die.&nbsp;What&#39;s your goal in doing all of this? Well, at the start of a round you are given a target to kill, and everyone knows who is targeting whom. If at the end of a round, your target is dead, you score 1 point; if you&#39;re alive, you score 1 point; if both of these things are true, you score a bonus point (3 total).

Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard&#39;s novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard&#39;s vision.&nbsp;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It&#39;s possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.&nbsp;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.&nbsp;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.&nbsp;The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).&nbsp;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal. &nbsp; Players 2-5 Playing time 60 minutes Ages 14+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973525,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/conan-core-box?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@400x400.jpg,145.99 AUD,Monolith,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lands of the empire are made up of a vast range of climates, cultures and landscapes, each controlled by a sovereign City. Mob football is a game generally played between neighbouring towns and villages on feast days, which accounts for its popularity. At its core, players on opposing teams clash and struggle to control a leather wrapped inflated pig&#39;s bladder and attempt to kick it into the opponent&rsquo;s goal. The powerful Guilds took advantage of the huge popularity of the sport and invested great sums of money, creating professional teams and structured leagues. The public went crazy as the game was elevated to new heights of spectacle. Guild Ball was born amidst a blaze of interest and publicity, and with it a whole new business and revenue stream for the Guilds. Games are now played out in front of immense crowds, whilst behind the scenes the results can mean fortunes are won or lost on the kick of a ball.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fisherman play style is all about movement and raw goal-scoring potential. They are dominant in the early game and can easily draw one or two goals ahead very quickly. However, mid to late game they need to be wary, especially if they lose a player or two.&nbsp;They excel at movement and kicking the ball - they are practically all about offense. Their combo play revolves around (re)positioning and exploitation of space.&nbsp;Whilst not entirely equipped with raw damage soaking defence, they instead have far subtler defensive options that focus much more on space control.&nbsp;&nbsp; This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Fishermanr&#39;s Guild.&nbsp;An excellent way of introducing yourself to the Guild Ball world and perfect to start enjoying the game right out of the box!

Time is against the Syrians, with not only the Israeli reserves arriving, but also as the SAM barrier gets reduced and the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force grows. The Syrians must strike hard and fast, then fight to hold on to their gains. &nbsp; Both players have a degree of variable setup that allows enhanced replay value, but still keeps the historical flavor.

Set in the Dystopian Universe, players take on the role of powerful crime bosses, building their criminal organizations by carefully recruiting new operatives with specialized skills and directing their team&rsquo;s nefarious deeds. All of your specialists are either in play or in your hand, ready to be used as you command. This unique hand-building mechanism gives you total control of your strategy. &nbsp; Grifters is all about stealing as much money as you can from the corrupt government, malicious corporations, and your rival players. Each player starts the game with a hand of six Specialist cards, each with unique abilities. Your objective is to use this team of six Specialists to recruit more criminals, complete jobs, steal from the government coffers and swindle your opponents. &nbsp; Each specialist has a special ability and skill. On your turn you can play a single specialist to perform their ability, or you can play a team of specialists to use their combined skills to complete a job. This means every specialist is a valuable asset to your criminal enterprise, earning immediate benefit through abilities and valuable end-game bonuses by completing jobs against the same target. And because all the cards in your deck are always available, you decide how to maximize your play. &nbsp; Grifters uses a unique card &quot;cooldown&quot; system to control the use of your cards. On your turn, you play one or more specialist cards into the first &quot;Night&quot; of your hideout. If you already have a specialist card, or a team of specialist cards, in night one those cards advance to night two and push other cards through your hideout. &nbsp; When a card is pushed out of the third night of your hideout it enters the refresh area. Any cards in your refresh area will return to your hand at the end of your turn. &nbsp; The game ends when the coffers run out of money, there are no more jobs left to complete, or if there are no more specialists cards left for recruiting. End game bonuses are calculated for completing multiple jobs against the same target. The player with the most money wins. &nbsp; Players 2-4 Playingt ime 30 minutes Ages 14",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973563,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/grifters?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973563.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973563@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973563@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973563@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973563@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973563@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973563@400x400.jpg,33.99 AUD,Indie Boards & Cards,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.89 AUD,,,,,,,,

Ships are divided into three sections: the front (bow), the middle (body), and the end (stern). During the course of the game, you will place supplies on the ships&rsquo; bows, while moving around their body pieces so that your clan has majority control of a ship when it sets sail. Stern pieces are used to show which ships have already set sail. Each turn, the active player will perform one of the remaining available actions. Actions include: taking first pick of actions next round, rearranging ships&#39; pieces (x4), placing bets on ships (x2), adding supplies to a ship (x2), increasing the value of supplies in the market, or setting sail. When a ship sets sail, players will share its supplies in order of how many times their clan&#39;s shield appears on the body pieces of that ship. Starting with the player with the most shields, players will claim a supply token of their choice from the bow of the ship and place it facedown on their scoring circle. These supply tokens will score points based on their value in the market at the end of the game. Additionally, if a player placed a bet on the clan that had majority control of the ship, then they take their winning bet and place it facedown on their scoring circle. The game ends after seven ships have set sail. Players calculate their final scores by adding together the value of their supply tokens with the value of their winning bets. The player with the most points wins.

Who will lead his family to fame and honor?&nbsp; Text from publisher:&nbsp; The position of the leader of the empire is vacant. But who has what it takes to become the new king? In order to increase their power, the contenders for the throne rally the country and its people around themselves. &nbsp; Who will make the best use of the influence of important personalities and engage his competitors in conflicts without suffering damage himself? Rival Kings is a stalwart card game from HUCH! &amp; friends. &nbsp; At the beginning of each cycle, each player chooses one Character card and places it face down in front of him. Once all players have done so, they turn them over simultaneously. The Character cards determine the order of play, the number of possible actions, and potential conflicts. Low-ranking characters have more actions at their disposal, but they may act only after the higher-ranking characters. In addition, each character may come into conflict with certain other characters. When this happens, the higher-ranking character may take one action from the inferior character and carry it out immediately; this action is then no longer available to the lower ranked during his turn. &nbsp; After the Character cards have been played and potential conflicts have been resolved, the action phase begins. Now, depending on the action, a player can take money, get rid of Conflict markers, recruit subjects, or buy a building. Players try to secure good combinations of buildings and subjects for themselves in order to get a high score in the end. Besides this, the subjects recruited during the game provide different advantages that can have a crucial impact on the course of the game. However, only one subject is active per player &ndash; if a new Subject card is added, it covers the player&#39;s previously laid-out bonus. &nbsp; The game ends as soon as one of the card piles has been depleted.

There it is, the starting signal!&nbsp; Dashing ahead with your chariot, slowly at first, but quickly gaining speed&hellip; circling the spina in the center of the arena to complete the first lap. The next corner comes closer. Glancing back, one of the chariots is already far behind, and just ahead another chariot&#39;s speed is too high for the corner, sending the vehicle crashing into the wall and out of the race. Only a single chariot blocks your path to victory, so it&#39;s time to get uncivilized. Steadily you balance the javelin in your hand, waiting for the other charioteer to come into view&hellip;or should you just overtake him and throw caltrops in his path?&nbsp; In Chariot Race: Das gro&szlig;e Wagenrennen, players participate as charioteers in a great race in ancient Rome. Use the dice to complete two laps on the dusty arena&#39;s circuit and be the first to steer your chariot over the finish line. On a player&#39;s turn, if they have gained enough Favors of Fortuna, they can repair their chariot. Depending on the chariot&#39;s speed on the previous turn and its current condition, the initial speed is determined, which defines how many of the five dice will be rolled during the turn. Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents (either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path). if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals. &nbsp; However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle &ndash; which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race. &nbsp; Players 2-6 Playing time 15-45 minutes Ages 8",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973590,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/chariot-race?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@400x400.jpg,36.99 AUD,Pegasus Entertainment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Japanese Sixth Army was facing the Soviet 57th Special Corps, including Mongolian cavalry. At first, the battles were only short skirmishes, but it soon escalated into open war. The whole campaign lasted 5 months and ended with a Soviet victory.&nbsp;The six standard scenarios of this expansion can be played separately or as a campaign, with each scenario outcome impacting the following one. The pre-printed Breakthrough scenarios, Bain Tsagan Heights and Tightening the Noose, can be played in the campaign as well as one of the two Overlord scenarios, Encirclement at Khalkhin-Gol.&nbsp;The second Overlord scenario, Cape Torokina Landings, highlights the fierce battle for Cape Torokina between US Marines and Japanese forces that took place years later &ndash; therefore it is not part of the campaign.&nbsp;This expansion also includes 6 Soviet BA-10 Armored Cars and 6 Japanese Type 97 Te-Ke tankettes that players will find useful for many of the scenarios included.&nbsp;The Battles of Khalkhin-Gol is designed for 2 to 8 players.

The six powers (USA, Europe, Russia, China, India, and Brazil) develop their industrial basis and build up armies and fleets. They fight over control of neutral land and sea areas in order to become the most powerful nation worldwide.&nbsp;In this game it is not the players who take turns, but the six powers, one after another. The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background. By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics. The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation&#39;s government and decides what the nation will do. As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time. As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return. Essentially the game is about money, and not about military domination!&nbsp;Imperial 2030 was released at Essen 2009 by PD-Games and Rio Grande Games.

Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin&#39;s attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them). &nbsp; The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH&rsquo;s victory. &nbsp; Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences. &nbsp; The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission. &nbsp; The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing. &nbsp; There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique. &nbsp; The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it&rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game. &nbsp; As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!&nbsp; Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity. &nbsp; Players 2-5 Playing time 90 minutes Ages 14",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973631,http://www.ozgameshop.com/miniature-board-games/the-others-core-box?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@400x400.jpg,149.49 AUD,Cool Mini Or Not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During set-up, you randomize which side of each map piece is up and place them in a 3x3 grid so that the middle place is left empty. &nbsp; The island is guarded by five Guardians, which are represented by Guardian cards. On each turn, players draft the Guardian cards so that each player gets the help of one Guardian. The Guardian cards decide turn order and they also give you special powers. With them, you can move and rotate, move your tokens, or gain first player marker for next turn. &nbsp; On your turn, you have three tokens to use. You use tokens to spread your influence by placing them on the board. You can also sacrifice tokens to be able to cross waters or enter forests. Or you can just sacrifice them in a volcano. At the end of the game, you get victory points for discovered temples and ruins on the map as well as sacrificed tokens. &nbsp; The layout of the islands changes constantly based on player actions, making Dokmus a dynamic, fast-paced game.

This mysterious installation, code named &ldquo;the Facility,&rdquo; uses unknown energies to morph and transform itself at will to keep horrid villains, dangerous creatures, alien entities, and top-secret research projects trapped within. Rumors of the Facility&rsquo;s existence and its most prized possessions have leaked, and the Valiant Universe&rsquo;s most powerful organizations&mdash;The Harbinger Foundation, the Renegades, GATE, and more&mdash;are taking an interest. The world may never be the same. &nbsp; In Valiant Universe: The Deck-Building Game you command an organization attempting to seize the secret Alcatraz base. Purchase cards to craft a unique deck, and battle your way through the ever-changing Facility grid that moves during play to gain access to a card or damage another player. Maneuver your superhero miniatures to battle it out with other superheroes for ultimate control!&nbsp; From the rules: &quot;Each player assumes the role of an Organization within the Valiant Universe, attempting to infiltrate the Facility and gain control while fighting off any other Organizations along the way. The Facility is abstractly represented by a grid of cards: 5 Levels (rows) x 5 Blocks (columns), for 25 decks of cards. Each deck on this grid is known as a Sector. To gain ultimate control of the Facility, each player will play cards from their hands to deal damage to other Organizations and manipulate the cards in the grid&mdash;which represents the Facility morphing and changing. Players will also have the opportunity to purchase cards from their Zone of Influence (ZOI) on the Facility. Additionally, players can move their Superhero miniature around the Facility&rsquo;s Sectors to deal additional damage to Opponents, while making use of their Abilities on their Power card. Along the way, the Facility may also strike back at the players. As fighting rages throughout the underground complex, damage is also inflicted not just to Organizations but to the Facility as well, marked using the Facility Durability Tracker. As more damage is received, more Sectors go into shutdown, making those cards unavailable for purchase, as well as potentially causing damage to a player&rsquo;s Organization. As Organizations take damage, their Cohesion drops; a measure of their overall strength, morale, leadership, and ability to keep fighting. If an Organization&rsquo;s Cohesion ever drops to 0, they retreat from the Facility and are out of the game.

Your opponent knows that you are preparing a major strike, but do they know where? Suddenly you receive reports that a spy has gained information about your operation, and the enemy shifts their defensive forces. But do they know the full extent of your plans? Should you call off the invasion and plan for a new attack? Or risk disaster against a prepared enemy? This is the fog of war... &nbsp; The Fog of War is a two-player grand strategic game covering the European theater of World War II from 1940 to 1944. One player plays the Axis forces, and the other the Allies. &nbsp; The game does not have units that move around a map; instead the game focuses on the planning and intelligence aspects of the war. Each player has a deck of cards that represent the army, navy, and other assets of their nations. A map shows the 28 land and sea provinces over which the players are battling. &nbsp; You defend a province by placing cards face down on the map. If you wish to attack a province, you must plan an &quot;operation&quot; to do so by creating one on your operation wheel. The wheel is a unique way of forcing players to commit to operations in advance, while giving opportunities for intelligence gathering and bluffing. An operation consists of a province card that shows the target of the operation, plus one or more cards to conduct the attack. All of these cards are placed face down, so your opponent does not know the target of the operation or the strength of the cards that are taking part. Each turn, the dial on the operation wheel is rotated by one position. This controls when an operation can be launched and any attack or defense bonuses that apply. &nbsp; In addition to combat forces for attack or defense, you may also spend Intel tokens to look at your opponent&rsquo;s operations and defenses. &nbsp; Players 2 Playing time 90-120 minutes Ages 10",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973650,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/fog-of-war?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@400x400.jpg,96.49 AUD,Stronghold Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins. &nbsp; Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on. &nbsp; On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors. &nbsp; The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion.

Luther criticized the selling of indulgences and stated that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the gospel. The &quot;Protestants&quot; soon incorporated doctrinal changes such as Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone) and Sola Fide (faith alone). These changes turned out to be not only theological, but also influential in the Reformation in other ways: the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded people&#39;s faith in the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much of traditional thought.

To set up, choose to use the black or copper side of the four game boards, then arrange them in a 2x2 square. Each game board shows nine dice, and once arranged the completed grid shows 36 dice, with the dice being numbered 1-6 and showing six colors, with each combination of number and color appearing exactly once. Roll the color die and number die to determine the starting location for the transparent robot, then mark this space with the transparent starting token. In a round, roll the two dice to determine the target space; you can mark this space with a transparent victory token or simply have everyone remember which space they&#39;re trying to reach. Everyone simultaneously tries to figure out how to move the robot to the target space, and to move the robot, it must move orthogonally to a space that shares either the color or number of its current location. If the robot starts on &quot;3-green&quot;, for example, it can move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 3 or is green; if you&#39;d move it to &quot;5-green&quot;, it can now once again move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 5 or is green; and so on. As soon as a player has a solution, they yell out the number of moves, then take the robot and demonstrate the solution. If the solution takes exactly the number of moves claimed, the player earns a victory token; if not, the player gives one of their victory tokens (if they have any) to the player with the fewest tokens. In either case, the former target space becomes the new starting space for the next round. If any player possesses five victory tokens, they win! If the 25 victory tokens are distributed before someone collects five, then whoever holds the most tokens wins, with ties being possible. Expert Micro Robots players can increase the challenge of the game by placing the target victory token on the board, then rolling the two dice once again. The players must now determine a solution that first moves the robot to the space showing on the dice, then to the final destination. The transparent robot in Micro Robots can also be used in Ricochet Robots. This robot moves like any other robot in that game except that for an additional move it can pass through a wall instead of stopping at it. It cannot move through the central barrier or the exterior walls, and the only target space on which it can land is the colored vortex. 2 - 99 Players 20 Min Playing Time Age: 8&nbsp;&nbsp;",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973672,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/micro-robots-board-games?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@400x400.jpg,28.49 AUD,Z-MAN GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On one side are the Athenians and the Delian League, the Demos team; against them, the Oligarchs of Sparta and Corinth are teamed. The Peloponnesian War is a great setting for a historical game, having two evenly matched factions with very differing capabilities. Athens (and the Delian League, including Corcyra) commanded the seas, and relied on trade to feed their masses. On land, the Spartan phalanx was virtually unbeatable, as all adult Spartan male citizens were professional soldiers Players of Quartermaster General will find most of the concepts familiar. Since the game has a smaller maximum player count, the amount of activity during a turn has been slightly increased.For example, after the Play step there is a Planning step, when you can place a Prepare card on the table. Prepare cards in Victory or Death work a lot like Response Cards in Quartermaster General, but have a much broader scope of application. Many Prepare cards are used during the Strategy step, which is at the beginning of a player&#39;s turn.

Faith among the mortals is waning and with it the very power of the pantheon. Zeus is in a rage: &quot;Hear me, gods! I command you to send forth my MONSTROUS pets. Make them rain from the sky and erupt from the underworld. We will rekindle these mortals&#39; faith - through FEAR!&quot;&nbsp;Monstrous is a game of gods and monsters, fear and faith, dexterous skills and tactical combos.&nbsp;Players are Greek gods throwing mythical monster cards from their hand onto a shared tableau of ancient Greek locations to gain as much &#39;Faith&#39; as possible. But a strong guiding hand is not enough - cunning use of tactical monster and location powers is the key to gaining the most faith of all the gods, and the favor of Zeus.&nbsp;During setup, a number of large location cards equal to the number of gods are arranged on the table - these are selected from 12 ancient Greek cities where the insolent humans cower. Locations have special powers and provide Faith when hit by Monsters. Depending on the number of gods playing, each god has a randomly constructed deck of between 7 and 10 out of 12 mythical monster cards, each with their own special power. Each god shuffles and readies these decks, then draws 3 of their monster cards ready to throw at locations and monsters already on the table.&nbsp;On their turn, a god chooses a single monster from their hand, and throws it (without their hand crossing the table edge) attempting to hit: 1. a location - to use its special power, and any thrown monster power that affect locations, and gain its Faith. 2. other monster cards on the table - to use the special power of their thrown monster on the other gods&rsquo; monsters.&nbsp;3. ideally both at the same time!&nbsp;Look for the best cards to throw and the best targets to throw at. But beware: monsters may do unpredictable and dangerous things. Some monsters even act like traps on the table, taking effect as soon as they are hit. If Olympus is in play, powerful legendary monsters can be gained for gods to throw too.&nbsp;Once a god has finished their turn, they draw a new monster and play proceeds to the next god. This proceeds until one god runs out of monster cards completely. Each other god then takes 1 final turn before the god with the highest Faith is declared the winner.&nbsp;Monstrous blends stunning art of mythic Greece with quick card throwing, fist pumping action and the tactical combos that gods and gamers love.

Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.&nbsp;The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:&nbsp;Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck. On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest. Two cards says &quot;Again&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &quot;Energy&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.&nbsp;Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.&nbsp;Players start with a hand of three option cards and five energy. Each option card has an energy cost, and you can purchase additional option cards for the cost of two energy each. Players can earn energy by programming it, by being the first to a pitstop, or by starting their turn on a pitstop.&nbsp;When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &quot;Normal&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &quot;spam&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.&nbsp; Players 2-6 Playing time 20-120 minutes Ages 12+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973690,http://www.ozgameshop.com/miniature-board-games/robo-rally-2016-edition?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973690.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973690@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973690@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973690@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973690@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973690@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973690@400x400.jpg,78.49 AUD,Hasbro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One player controls a vile king and his knightly lackeys who try to force their way into the castle through a mob of wrathful citizens. The other player controls the mob itself and more importantly three assassins who hide among the crowd hoping to kill or stop the ruler long enough for the people to deal with him using their bare fists. The king has only so much time before he is overpowered by his own subjects but using guile and swords of his guards he may be able to eliminate the assassins and hopefully escape into the safety of his palace.The gameplay is based upon Action Cards which show a limited number of Action Points available to both sides. First, the king and his knights move around the board securing their position or eliminating dangers by pushing aside the crowd, then the assassins hidden among the crowd prepare for their lethal strike by killing guards or making the king&#39;s progress slower. It&#39;s up to the players to make the most of the Action Points available in the current round. The king&#39;s player wins if he manages to escape from the board using one of the exits or if his knights eliminate all the assassins. The assassins win if they kill the king by dealing him two wounds or stall him long enough so that the Action Card deck is depleted.Choose your strategy, hide the assassins among twelve beautifully illustrated citizens and play two different scenarios, each with a multitude of choices, in this simple yet rewarding game.

You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive... In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area. Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers: Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid. Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player&#39;s character. Contessa: Block an assassination attempt. Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you. Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you. On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions: Income: Take one coin from the treasury. Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury. Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins, you must take this action.) When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else&#39;s action &ndash; that character&#39;s action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can&#39;t reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you&#39;re out of the game. If you do have the character in question, you reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings. The game includes three different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player&#39;s own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards. Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc. In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.)

The runners and corporate executives who direct the struggles of Android: Netrunner lead frantic lives full of fantastic highs and staggering lows, and the pace doesn&#39;t slow a beat in Mala Tempora. Many of its sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) encourage daring gambles, staking health and fortunes against opportunities to rapidly accelerate wealth and success. Of course, in an age of technological one-upmanship, why play fair? Mala Tempora also introduces a number of programs and ice that allow runners and corps to &quot;cheat&quot; these wagers by stealing information about their opponents&#39; cards.

You&#39;ve raided the dungeon, killed the monsters, and taken their treasure. Now you&#39;re back in our homeland, and what better way to celebrate your most recent victory than to spend an evening at the Red Dragon Inn. You and your adventuring companions will spend the night drinking, gambling, and roughhousing. The last person who is both sober enough to remain conscious and shrewd enough to hold onto his Gold Coins wins the game. Now you&#39;ve taken to the high seas aboard The Crimson Drake, a sturdy sailing vessel that the heroes you know and love use when their adventures take them to sea. Join the crew in the Captain Whitehawk&#39;s cabin for a pint and try to keep your sea legs! &nbsp;Captain Whitehawk: Captain Whitehawk is the stalwart master of the Crimson Drake. She&#39;s a natural leader with years of experience and a wit as sharp as her saber. She&rsquo;ll take the crew to hell and back for adventure and loot, and make damn sure they have a roaring good time while they&#39;re at it. &nbsp;First Mate Remy: An elf from faraway lands, Remy is an honor-bound swashbuckler who keeps the crew in line; he&rsquo;ll be the first to step in and break up a fight. The seasoned sailors know to back down before they get on his bad side. &nbsp;Bryn the Boatswain: Bryn is tough as nails and knows how to keep a ship afloat. When she&#39;s not making repairs or loading provisions, she enjoys sparring with the crew&hellip; all of them&hellip; at the same time... &nbsp;Tara the Navigator: Tara was born blind, but with the gift of second sight. With her knack for seeing the future, she is an invaluable, if unlikely, navigator for the Crimson Drake. After predicting countless storms and monster attacks she has earned the trust of Captain Whitehawk and her crew. The Red Dragon Inn 4 includes a Sea Event Deck that provides a new way to play RDI. Instead of the relative safety of the inn, players are now partying in the Captain&#39;s cabin aboard the Crimson Drake &ndash; and because you&#39;re out on an adventure, the party runs the risk of being interrupted by random encounters. In game terms, at the start of the game you shuffle the Sea Event Deck and place it in the middle of the table with two Progress Counters on it. You then play RDI like normal, but at the end of each player&#39;s turn, that player removes a Progress Counter from the Sea Event Deck. When you remove the last Progress Counter, reveal the top card and an Event takes place. The Sea Event Deck adds a new level of complexity to the base game. Not only will you need to protect yourself from the other players, as well as the Drink Deck, but you may find yourself forced to defend against a Sea Event. You could even end up working alongside other players to get a bonus from the various Events you&#39;ll see throughout a game.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973730,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-card-games/the-red-dragon-inn-4?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973730.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973730@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973730@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973730@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973730@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973730@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973730@400x400.jpg,62.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This time they take the gaming action to the African Front, from the start of Operation Compass on 8 December 1940, through 1942 to the eviction of the Axis from Libya. Building on the notion of a card assisted game and death-or-glory victory conditions, No Retreat: The North African Front offers a narrative game rich in the feel for the ebb-and-flow of the campaign, wrapped around an exciting maneuver and combat system that harkens back to the glory days of classic wargaming, but includes all the modern features and plenty of innovations. Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 &quot;mini-maps&quot; located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating &quot;mini-games&quot; in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game. This Deluxe Edition combines both the original game, featuring Five quick-playing scenarios, a Tournament Game, a Full-Fledged Campaign game, and a Bonus &quot;Invasion of Crete&quot; mini-game, all using deluxe components of &quot;Twillight Struggle Deluxe Edition&quot; quality. The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine. The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.

Your Super Hero has an ability that will guide your strategy throughout the game. Each player starts with his own basic 10-card deck and draws a hand of 5 cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &ldquo;Line-Up&rdquo; from which players make their purchases. Each player will always have five face-up cards to choose from each turn, so every turn there are new options and surprises. When a player has amassed enough Power, he or she may defeat the current Super-Villain. When a Super-Villain is defeated, a new one appears and makes an Attack against each player in the game! Players can defend themselves with Defense cards like Force Field, the Helmet of Fate, or several others. In the end, the player who has accumulated the most Victory Points from the cards in his or her deck wins the game. This is the follow-up to the 2012 hit DC Comics Deck-building Game.

Dr. Stinson asked quickly. Hiccups? Mr. Parsons asked in his usual, genial manner. She felt her stomach churn - how did she ever find that phony charisma so charming?

Her eyes darted around the familiar headquarters of the Freedom Five, but not everything seemed like how shed left it. Things were different. She was different. She had died. The darkness had lifted to unveil a changed world. Or perhaps, perhaps only she had changed? She went to the sink to fill the Worlds Finest Assistant&quot; mug Dr. Stinson gave her three years before they let her die. The handle had yet to crack.This world was most definitely different than the one she left, but no difference cast such a stark contrast as the difference she felt inside.

However, her family was shocked when she began building and inventing things without even touching them. She could simply think about the components in front of her and begin assembling them in her mind, and the pieces would align themselves! She was a technopath &ndash; anything she could visualize, she could build, given the right parts. By the time she was eighteen, she had already dropped out of three different universities, as she didn&#39;t have the patience for classes. She spent her time cobbling her pencils, paperclips, and other students&#39; belongings into adorable mechanical golems which danced around the classroom, which did not go over well with anyone. Recently, she received word from the Eaken-Rubendall Laboratories that there may be a position open for a person of her skills, if she would be interested in working with Dr. Stinson... Unity, the technopath, uses her innate abilities to control technology and create mechanical golems to fight for her.

The game plays out on a small game board representing regions of 5 ancient civilizations, Medes, Sumerians, Hitites, Persians, and Assyrians. Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes). Players themselves are represented by stone figures. Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game. On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe. Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns. A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker. By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used. No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand. Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated. Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins. If the opponent [i]does have[/i] more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).

Every game is played over a series of rounds, as you and your opponents play character cards in an attempt to claim the Iron Throne for yourselves. In each round, you pursue your own plans and seek to foil your opponents by playing character cards. Each turn, you will play a character card from your hand, adding to the court at King&rsquo;s Landing. You can advance your own prospects by playing your character cards cleverly, but certain rules govern exactly where you can place your character cards. The first character cards must be played in a single row, forming the bottom row of the court. Once there are two cards in a row, you may play a card in a new row above them. The card that you play in the new row, however, must match the House of one of the two cards below it. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, character cards are divided between House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and House Targaryen, and each player may have character cards from any of these Houses in his hand. The court develops as you and your opponents play cards, but a player will eventually discover that he can no longer legally play a character card. Once this occurs, that player is eliminated and the round continues. A round ends when no one can play another character card, and whoever played the last character card wins the round. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you will play rounds equal to the number of players. If you win a round of Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you reap the rewards by drawing an Iron Throne card, which cancels a number of your penalty points. Your opponents, on the other hand, must take penalty points equal to the number of character cards that they have left in their hand. Over the course of the game, players gain penalty points from having character cards at the end of the round, and reduce their penalty points by winning a round and drawing an Iron Throne card. At the end of the game, the player with the least penalty points wins!

Here is a run down on what is new in the 2nd edition release: Backwards compatibility is completely maintained between editions. You can use 2nd Edition with your original edition core game and vice versa. The 2nd Edition core game has a sturdy new telescoping box, while 2nd edition expansions have double width tuckboxes. Timing icons in the style of Cthulhu Gloom and Unquiet Dead are incorporated throughout the 2nd Edition Rules cards and icon reminder cards are included in each 2nd Edition for easy reference The card list and the effect texts of individual cards have been polished for a better play experience. For example complex cards like &quot;Body Theif&quot; and cards with delayed effects have been removed. Three Modifiers have been turned into Transformations in Unwelcome Guests 2nd Edition Residences and Mysteries have been reworked in the 2nd Edition so that you can no longer end up with unusable cards in your hand. All the story icons and few family icons in the 2nd edition have been redrawn by artist Todd Remick. Gloom 2nd Edition uses the discard rule from Cthulhu Gloom Death cards in the 2nd edition have a central art piece, as Cthulhu Gloom does as well as a blank story icon at the top right. Characters no longer flip upon death. Event cards in the 2nd Edition have a center illustration and a blank icon in the top right spot to give them the silhouette as a Death Card. Guests in the 2nd Edition have reminder text in the family icon spot, as Cthulhu Gloom does. Pathos Points are now called Self-Worth Points to avoid unnecessary proliferation of game terms. A number of mechanical changes have been made in the rule sheet. For example timing icons, symbols on Event cards and the new discard rule have been accounted for.&nbsp; The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice&mdash;just when it seems like things can&#39;t get any worse, they do. But some say that one&#39;s reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope&mdash;if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.&nbsp;In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You&#39;ll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents&#39; characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.&nbsp;Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You&#39;ll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You&#39;ve got to see (through) this game to believe it!&nbsp;Each of the three expansions for Gloom adds one more player, thus with all three expansions, this should be playable with seven players.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973812,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/gloom-2nd-edition-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@400x400.jpg,31.99 AUD,ATLAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or if they transmit signals into space, might their echoes ever linger, gain a sort of permanence in their repetition, and impact future events?&nbsp;The sixty new cards from The Spaces Between (three copies each of twenty different cards), re-examine the essential natures of the game&#39;s events and operations, and every faction gains a new current, an event or operation that isn&#39;t immediately resolved and discarded after it&#39;s played, but continues to reside in the data streams somewhere between a state of transience and a state of permanence.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973813,http://www.ozgameshop.com/card-game-expansions/android-netrunner-the-spaces-between-data-pack?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973813.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973813@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973813@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973813@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973813@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973813@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973813@400x400.jpg,20.99 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game. In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players. Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being: Take a card on display and add it to your hand. Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player. Visit the opera and spend $2. Adjust the value modifiers in the property market. Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards. Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy. At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market. If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973822,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/last-will?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@400x400.jpg,59.99 AUD,Iello,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the start of each turn, players have five cards in hand, with six cards being face-up on the table as a card market. During the turn, players first have a chance to exchange some cards from their hands with those in the market, then they play and resolve their cards step by step, performing actions, trading and gathering resources, and most importantly, refining certain resources into other resources to earn victory points. Crystals on the players&#39; individual resource boards keep track of their resources as they are bought and sold. Crystals placed beside the board represent player&#39;s coins. The final score is determined after the fourth turn, with players selling any remaining resources to score additional victory points (one point per four coins).

Each player has two transport ships in the center of his Home card and a cruiser on an edge. Cruisers are used to patrol sectors of space and destroy opposing transports, while transports let you activate sectors that you enter.

The Impulse is a line of cards shared by all players that changes turn by turn as players add cards to it and as cards fall off once it reaches maximum size. Thus, players need to feed the Impulse with actions that benefit them more than opponents, but that&#39;s easier said than done. When you perform actions &ndash; whether from moving transports to them or using the Impulse &ndash; you can boost them by having minerals of the same color or lots of transports.

The wager that nothing would happen. That wager was lost. And from that loss came the Wager Master. As reality formed and matter came into being, all of the losing wagers - all of the impossible possibilities - also formed into being. Into a specific being: the Wager Master. The Wager Master appears however it wants. It commonly goes for centuries without showing up anywhere in the Multiverse. But when it does show up, it&#39;s a safe bet that things will go wrong. The Wager Master thrives on playing with the rules of reality. It appears to a race of sentient beings, plays games with whatever champions they might have, and ultimately destroys everything it encounters as they inevitably lose the Wager Master&#39;s games. Those who lose to the Wager Master become mere playing pieces for more twisted games. Now, unfortunately, the capricious Wager Master has appeared on earth. Too many things have gone wrong. Too many coincidences and too many confluences point to the truth: we are all pawns in the cruel game of an entity as old as the Multiverse.

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&nbsp;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&nbsp;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&nbsp;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things -- keep it and de-equip an equipment or place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&nbsp;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&nbsp;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&nbsp; Players 2-4 Suggested Ages 10 Playing Time 30 minutes",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973880,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-card-games/welcome-to-the-dungeon-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@400x400.jpg,21.49 AUD,Iello,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Take orders for the tables in your section, gather the plates to fill those orders, and serve your tables, and do it as quickly as possible while showing up the other players. Diner features a pseudo-real time mechanic that has players passing action tokens whenever they take an action; if a player does not have a token, that player can&#39;t take an action. At times, action tokens may accumulate in front of a player, allowing them to take multiple actions at once. Diner is the winner of the Dice Hate Me Games 54-Card Challenge - a contest that challenged designers to create a game using only 54 cards and very minimal components. It was selected as winner among over 100 participants. Additional description from interview posted at: http://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/28649/chris-kirkman-on-his-family-of-rabbits Diner puts players in the shoes of someone serving patrons at a greasy spoon. The goal is to earn the most in tips by gathering plates of various types from the kitchen and then serving them to a table of patrons in your section demanding certain orders. The real magic of the game is in the pseudo-real time action system. When you want to take an action - say, seat a table in your section - you have to have an action token in front of you. When you perform the action you pass the token to the player next to you. Sometimes those action tokens can pile up allowing you to do multiple things at once. Other times you&rsquo;re urging the other players to hurry up a bit so you can serve your tables. It&rsquo;s a very madcap, social experience, with lots of table talk. With the action tokens, though, it&rsquo;s not total chaos like many real-time games - there is a lot of of control worked into the mechanics. It&rsquo;s a brilliant design, and one that will appeal to many gamers whether they like real-time games or not.

When proposing, if a Gentleman&#39;s Charm is lower than the Lady&#39;s, he must discard cards to make up the difference. If he wants to really impress her, he can discard additional cards to boost his Charm.

If she declines - paying cards if necessary to counter his Charm offensive - the Gentleman returns to the player&#39;s hand to brush up on his manners.

On your turn, you can take any of the actions of the five characters in play, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of two general actions:&nbsp;Income: Take one coin from the treasury. Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.) When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else&#39;s action &ndash; that character&#39;s action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can&#39;t (or don&#39;t) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you&#39;re out of the game.&nbsp;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&nbsp;The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!&nbsp;Coup: Rebellion G54 is a new standalone game that takes the same simple Coup mechanisms and rules, but with a variable deck of 25 characters, and in each game you choose to play with five out of the 25, so the relative power and advantage of each character changes from game to game.

Football had become the predominant national pastime &mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne! Starting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or &#39;Borgs as they&#39;re affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding &#39;Bots are on the way. Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it&#39;s hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue! The stage is now set! The fans are energized and root fanatically for their new favorites, be they &#39;Bots, &#39;Borgs or Naturals! Baseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game&#39;s highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays.

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&nbsp;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&nbsp;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.

Their daughter couldn&rsquo;t talk yet, but she &ldquo;spoke&rdquo; to machines. More alarmingly, when she did, they fell into their components, which created a metallic cocoon for the child. None of this was covered by the parenting classes the Moore family had attended. A representative of a group called the Ironclad Project offered to take care of Evelyn, but only if her parents were willing to sign her over to the care of the project. Seeing no other option, they agreed, and Evelyn became the ward of the Ironclad Project.&nbsp;Years went by, and Evelyn grew, learning to control her powers. She was told that she was being trained to be a part of the army. A new army that fought with better power instead of hundreds of soldiers. However, her lack of control and her hot-headedness meant that the Ironclad Project had little use for her. She had learned to absorb tech to plate herself in steel and coat her skin in wires, talking to the tech as easily as she talked to herself, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. Even though she desperately wanted to prove her worth, those monitoring her kept wanting more than she could give.&nbsp;Then, one day, she absorbed a tank.&nbsp;There had been talk of military training going on in the adjacent facility, and Evelyn wanted to know more. Sneaking past her monitors, she found herself next to a massive M1 Abrams tank. It spoke to her of cold steel and internal combustion. It sounded beautiful to her. So she let it fall into its pieces, and she wore its skin.&nbsp;All hell broke loose in the army base. A tank had just fallen apart, and a person-shaped pile of plate-steel walked out of the wreckage. Soldiers opened fire on the figure, who ran through a wall, disappearing into the nearby hills.&nbsp;Since then, Choke has been a regular opponent of the Freedom Five and their allies. She is frequently at the heart of troubles concerning military installations or stockpiles of weapons. It was hardly surprising that she ended up allying with the Vengeful Five when Baron Blade called. But when she was fatally wounded by K.N.Y.F.E., many believed that would be the end of Choke.&nbsp;However, Choke had heard a peculiar voice - unlike any she had heard before. The Freedom Five had recently prevented Deadline from destroying the earth, and the alien&rsquo;s odd device was still housed in their headquarters. And she could hear its voice. It could save her, and she could give it purpose once again.&nbsp;Evelyn drew the resonating crystal at the heart of the device into herself, sealing her wound, but also opening her mind to the powers of the alien tech. It could sense weak points. She was originally trained to save the world, and now she knew how. She would show those at Project Ironclad that she was worthwhile after all. Using her new knowledge, she would erase all the weak points from the world. All she needed was a bit more power&hellip;&nbsp;With the necessary elements right at hand, Chokepoint was born. Taking power from the tech of the heroes around her, Evelyn is on a self-appointed quest to destroy the weak points of the world, and beyond.&nbsp;Chokepoint&rsquo;s scope is without limit. She already has growing concerns that the star at the center of this galaxy will eventually die or explode, and that getting rid of it sooner rather than later might be necessary&hellip;&nbsp;Chokepoint is a mini-expansion given as a pre-order bonus for Sentinels of the Multiverse: Villains of the Multiverse.&nbsp; Players 1-5",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974032,http://www.ozgameshop.com/card-game-expansions/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-chokepoint-villain-mini-expansion?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974032.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974032@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974032@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974032@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974032@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974032@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974032@400x400.jpg,10.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes, when the mood strikes you&mdash;or when your heroes take a wrong turn&mdash;you may see that road darken&hellip; and then darken again. &nbsp; Nightmare Decks allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios recast within the darker and deadlier shadows of Nightmare Mode. Each Nightmare Deck introduces new encounter cards that you exchange with specified cards from the adventure&#39;s standard encounter deck. The result is a more challenging adventure that comes full of novel and thematic new twists. &nbsp; Bundled as one sixty-card product, The Road Darkens Nightmare Decks modify each of the three scenarios from The Road Darkens Saga Expansion. Because each Saga Expansion endeavors to stay as faithful to the books as possible, it may sound like a daunting task to create sixty new cards to reshape the Fellowship&#39;s travels through the second half of The Fellowship of the Ring, but lead developer Caleb Grace assures us that the Nightmare Deck afforded him a welcome opportunity to include many of the story elements he was pained to cut from the scenarios in Standard Mode:&nbsp; I&#39;m always excited to design Nightmare Decks for our Saga Expansions because there are always things that I had wanted to include, but we simply didn&rsquo;t have the room. While working on The Road Darkens, I found myself saying things like, &ldquo;This will have to go in the Nightmare version&rdquo; whenever I had to cut something that I liked. For example, serious fans of The Lord of the Rings may have lamented the exclusion of the Watcher in the Water&rsquo;s many tentacles, or the absence of the Balrog&rsquo;s fiery whip and flaming sword. Nightmare Decks give us the opportunity not only to increase the difficulty of the scenarios, but to appeal to our fans by introducing more of these memorable parts of the story. &nbsp;",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974062,http://www.ozgameshop.com/card-game-expansions/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-the-road-darkens-nightmare-decks?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974062.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974062@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974062@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974062@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974062@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974062@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974062@400x400.jpg,30.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With Seer Kel, you can always find the spaces between bodies to ensure your attacks strike home. Even as you use your unnatural sight to look past those who would stand in your way, you may gaze into the future and see what plans the overlord player has in store for the heroes. As your heroic feat with Seer Kel, you can look at the top five cards of the Overlord deck, giving you unparalleled insight into the traps and punishment that will shortly arrive! What&rsquo;s more, you can choose one of these cards and place it on the bottom of the Overlord deck before you shuffle the remaining cards and replace them on top of the deck. In this way, you can mitigate the most dangerous possible threat before it ever becomes reality. Ultimately, you&rsquo;ll need magical tricks like this to achieve victory in Stewards of the Secret, especially as the overlord player calls upon horrific monsters spawned by ancient sorcery. &nbsp; The ferrox can sap the power of their enemies and use it to repair their own bodies.

When you call upon the ferrox as the overlord player, you&rsquo;ll quickly see the attributes that made them such useful servants for Devis. A ferrox can hit dangerously hard in melee combat, and it can spend its surges to pierce even the thickest plate armor and spread disease to hinder the heroes turn after turn. The master ferrox boasts an even more dangerous ability. By spending an action, a master ferrox can use Extract to choose an adjacent hero. That hero must test its might&mdash;if he fails, he suffers two fatigue, and the ferrox recovers two damage! Not only does Extract give your ferrox unexpected staying power, dealing fatigue can restrict the heroes&rsquo; movement and their use of Class cards.

Players ante one coin to begin, and start with a hand of six cards. Everyone plays one card, and the lowest of these will go first. &nbsp; On your turn you may either play a new card face up, or call one of your opponents. &nbsp; When you play a card, you are trying not to play the last card of that rank. For example, if you play a 5, you are declaring that someone&#39;s hand still contains a 5. If you have one, you know you&#39;re safe. If not. you&#39;re making an educated guess. &nbsp; A call ends the hand. When you call another player, you are saying that they were wrong when they played their last card, and there are no more cards of that rank left in anyone&#39;s hand. &nbsp; If the caller is right, she wins the pot, plus a penalty equal to the rank of the card, paid by the called player. (For example, 7 coins for calling a 7.) If the caller is wrong, the called player wins the pot, and he wins the same penalty from the caller. &nbsp; There are two ways to get ahead in Deadfall: you can catch people when they play the wrong cards, and you can trick others into calling you when you&#39;re safe.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974104,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-card-games/deadfall-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974104.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974104@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974104@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974104@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974104@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974104@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974104@400x400.jpg,21.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal for both players is to ensure that when the hand ends, the playing field has cards of these colors and these colors only. &nbsp; Each round, the detective draws as many cards as he wishes from the shuffled deck, putting them on the playing field according to the marks on the cards. The deck also contains ravens, which when drawn will &quot;eat&quot; any discarded cards of that color and threaten to take them out of the game. &nbsp; When the detective player is done, the Ren player picks one of the cards in the playing field and puts on the leftmost still &quot;incomplete&quot; hidden card. A hidden card is complete when that card plus the cards placed on it total 7. (The fourth pile, however, should total only 5, according to the Japanese poem metric &quot;dodoitsu&quot; that goes 7-7-7-5.)&nbsp; Once all four hidden cards are completed, the round ends and unless the playing field has exactly the colors represented among the hidden cards, the players have failed. The game is played for three hands, but in the final hand, one hidden card must be completed per round, lest the players fail.

Players can opt out of fighting to bank their blood and save it permanently. Collected blood counts as victory points.&nbsp;Designer Eric M.

Blurring the traditional lines between roleplaying and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&nbsp;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you&#39;ve dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you&#39;ll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&nbsp;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you&#39;ll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world&#39;s most terrifying mysteries.&nbsp;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You&#39;ll find cultists and foul rituals. You&#39;ll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...&nbsp;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham&#39;s landscape, burning buildings to the ground.

You are one of the many wizards who have come to claim the stone, but gaining control of the stone won&rsquo;t be an easy task. &nbsp; This free-for-all magical showdown pits 2-6 wizards against each other over a series of rounds. Each round is a magical duel between all the wizards, which includes six different types of magic: Blades, Fireball, Frost Wave, Lightning, Quake and Metamagic. These magic types will aid wizards in their duel. &nbsp; Players take turns casting an initial spell that will set the rule for the round, set the rank other players must beat, and earn them a potential Shard (VP). Players then take turns playing cards of equal or higher rank from their hands to the table; if they match the spell suit, they place a Shard on that card. The round ends when a player can no longer play a valid card from their hand. The player that could not play a card returns any Shards on their played cards back to the center, then takes card damage equal to the amount of Shards that are still on cards. All other players then take the Shards on cards they played to their Victory Pool. The player who played the last card gets a bonus Shard. &nbsp; When a player takes damage, they draw cards from the deck equal to the amount of damage and place them face down in front of them. If they ever accumulate 5 damage, they immediately discard their hand and a Shard, then take their damage cards in to their hand. &nbsp; The game ends when one player has enough Shards. 15 in a two-player game, 12 for three or four players, and 10 for five or six. &nbsp; Players 2-6 Playing time 20-45 minutes Ages 14",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974205,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-card-games/manasurge?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974205.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974205@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974205@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974205@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974205@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974205@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974205@400x400.jpg,33.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a turn, a player plays as many cards as desired by paying the cost of each card &mdash; that is, discarding cards of the proper colors that match the cost of the card being played &mdash; then placing the card in an empty slot on their side of the game board. Many cards have powers that take effect when played. &nbsp; After playing cards on a turn, each card does damage equal to its strength to any opponent&#39;s card on the other side of the game board. If no opponent&#39;s card is present, then with military power the player does damage directly to the opponent, swinging a pendulum of strength in their favor. If you reach a total of 7 on the pendulum, you win. Your troops can also grant you an additional card at the end of the turn (three instead of two) or tokens that make it cheaper to play cards. &nbsp; Instead of winning via military, you can instead win by having all six slots on your side of the board filled with cards at the start of your turn.

Each monster has a lane indicator that tells the player which lane the monster will enter. The field itself is 5 rows by 4 lanes. If ever 2 monsters enter the same lane, the second one pushes the first one farther toward the player. &nbsp; In the player phase, the active player uses defenses and tricks to protect themselves or damage other player&#39;s fields. The active player always starts their player phase with 5 cards in their hand. &nbsp; In the movement phase, each monster moves down the field one tile. If they run into a defense, combat happens and either the monster or defense with the higher power wins combat. &nbsp; In the cleanup phase, players finish any effects that need to resolve, remove any defenses or monsters that have been destroyed in combat, and refill their hand up to 5 cards total. &nbsp; The player who is the last person standing is the winner!&nbsp; Players 2-4 Playing time 30 minutes Ages 12",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974231,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/gingerdead-house?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974231.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974231@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974231@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974231@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974231@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974231@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974231@400x400.jpg,56.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Featuring art by the French illustrator Marina Coudray, Dixit: Revelations looks utterly unlike any Dixit expansion that has preceded it. Coudray&#39;s mysterious and enchanting images are heavily influenced by early twentieth century design, from the Art Deco movement to Surrealism, even while they convey stories and ideas that may be millennia old. In her art you&rsquo;ll find echoes of Picasso, Magritte, Matisse, Escher, Greek myth, Indian religion, pop music, internet memes, and much, much more... In these stylized pieces, reminiscent of New York City&rsquo;s architecture and glass Tiffany lamps, you&rsquo;ll find many allusions to ancient myths and folk tales.&nbsp;Dixit: Revelations is an expansion for Dixit that contains 84 new cards for use with that game. In Dixit, each round one player takes on the role of Storyteller, choosing one card from his hand, then telling a story, singing a ditty, or otherwise doing something that in his opinion is associated with the played card. Each other player then chooses one card in her own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller. If either no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then he receives no points; if he received some votes but not all of the votes, he scores based on the number of votes received. Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on her card submission also scores. After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most points wins.&nbsp; Players 3-6 Playing time 30 minutes",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974238,http://www.ozgameshop.com/card-game-expansions/dixit-7-revelations-expansion?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974238.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974238@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974238@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974238@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974238@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974238@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974238@400x400.jpg,29.99 AUD,ASMODEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diamond will rob Ruby of a gem if he gets a chance (hence the minus symbol), but Sapphire will get an extra gem from the ruby mine supply with the help of his friend (hence the plus symbol). Friend Actions (+ pluses) are cumulative allowing you take several gems in one turn. Foe Actions (-minuses) rob other players of valuable gems. The crux of the game is to know how and when to take advantage of the Dwarfs&rsquo; friendships and rivalries for your gain.&nbsp; Players 2-5 Playing time 30-45 minutes Ages 14+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974239,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-card-games/mine-all-mines?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974239.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974239@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974239@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974239@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974239@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974239@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974239@400x400.jpg,54.99 AUD,IDW Publishing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And still the stench grew.&quot; &ndash;J.R.R. Tolkien, The Two Towers&nbsp;Beneath the Sands is the third Adventure Pack in the Haradrim cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, and its new scenario makes it clear that there&#39;s more than Haradrim to fear among the lands of Harad. As several of Middle-earth&#39;s greatest heroes continue their perilous homeward journey through the hostile lands of Harad, they find evidence that a pack giant spiders have dragged people under the dunes. Compelled to investigate, these heroes must crawl into the spider&#39;s tunnels, only to navigate a scenario that weaves through a labyrinth of cobweb-choked darkness, blocked passages, and deadly spiders. Time is of the essence, as the spiders&#39; victims may yet be alive, but you&#39;ll need to be clever and attentive lest you become lost underground.&nbsp;With scenario-specific rules that allow you to squander your progress when you get off-track, even if you quest successfully, Beneath the Sands places an emphasis upon the game&#39;s questing and exploration in a way that truly allows you to feel trapped in a maze. Fortunately, the Adventure Pack also comes with a new Scout hero and twenty-seven player cards (three copies each of nine different cards) to help you get back onto the proper path &ndash; or forge your own.&nbsp;This is not a standalone product.

The human players win by reaching Kobol, but the Galactica will be threatened by a host of challenges along the way. Only through the cooperation of the humans will the ship (and fleet) survive. The Cylon player(s) wins by either destroying the Galactica with attacks from the Cylon fleet, or, through sabotage, by reducing one of the necessary resources (Food, Fuel, Population, or Morale) to zero.&nbsp;Either all of the humans win together, or all of the Cylons win together&hellip;but both sides must figure out who they can trust in order to achieve victory.&nbsp;Players&#39; identities are secret and no one will know for certain at the beginning of the game who they can trust.

Set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODS, for short. Human commanders still lead these mechanized troops, but these commanders each have special powers and abilities. These come into play via the use of Command cards, which really add a whole new dimension to the game and gives it a much-needed face-lift. Now, the battle is not just for the earth, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds.&nbsp;Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk. One very welcome change has been the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours.

From our branch offices in this monument of human achievement, NBN proudly broadcasts all your favorite media programming. We offer fully comprehensive streaming in music and threedee, news and sitcoms, classic movies and sensies. We cover it all. Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that&#39;s fit to view. Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners. Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation&#39;s virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network. In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It&#39;s not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort&#39;s defenses, there&#39;s no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing. The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity. Monolithic megacorps and individualistic netrunners collide in a dystopian future. Set in the gritty, cyberpunk future of Android, Android: Netrunner is a two-player Living Card Game that rewards skill, strategy, and just the right amount of calculated risk. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment&nbsp; High-stakes futuristic gambles and intrigues in a cyberpunk setting Four corporations and three runner classes spark imaginative deck designs Playing time 30-60 mins Ages 13 2 Players",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974383,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-card-games/android-netrunner-living-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@400x400.jpg,55.99 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of the Napoleonic Wars, Spain was only a shadow of its former power. Spanish troops and leaders, as many Napoleonic historians point out, performed badly on a large number of occasions. Yet there are a number of battles, Bailen, Tamames, Alcaniz and San Marcial where the Spaniards fought valiantly and gained victory. Ironically, the point most historians overlook is the fact that the Spanish armies constituted a threat that the French simply could not ignore. As good as Wellington&#39;s Anglo-Portuguese field army was, that army faced multiple French armies. They could only defeat one French army at a time. The Spanish Armies and the accompanying guerrilla warfare against French troops tied down the remainder, allowing the Anglo-Portuguese army to ultimately emerge victorious.

But wait ? these aren&#39;t the knights of old but rather their children. Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it&#39;s too late? In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high. In game terms the quests are represented by five types of cards with each card showing 1-3 swords as well as a number from 1 to 4 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either: Reveals a rumor card. Attempts a quest. Accuses a knight. To reveal a rumor card the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it&#39;s a quest card players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed players can no longer speak to one another; in addition Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again. Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11 12 or 13. Any lower and they arrived too soon wasting time; any higher and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest the player points to the top quest card and says It&#39;s time. The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13 then the players receive 1-3 white swords as shown on the quest cards. If lower they receive one black sword; if higher 1-3 black swords.&nbsp;,https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974465,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-board-games/shadows-over-camelot-the-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(16/01/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@400x400.jpg,32.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somewhere below Golarion&#39;s darkest markets sprawls a hidden warren of particularly vile gnoll &quot;traders&quot; who must be stopped! When a Twilight Talon of the Eagle Knights goes missing, the adventurers are granted leave by Katapesh&#39;s eerie masters to take up arms against what would otherwise be &quot;legal business&quot; in the unforgiving city.

A decision made in Game 1 could come back to haunt you in Game 10. Players shape how the world evolves: its history, its cities, even its factions and how they fight. Cards and stickers will come into play or go out of play forever. You don&rsquo;t forget past betrayals &ndash; and neither does the game. At first, the game plays much like regular Risk. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world and through simple combat they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board. What&rsquo;s different is that Risk Legacy changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions and at the start of the game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule. When factions are chosen, players must pick one of their two powers, affix that power&rsquo;s sticker to their faction card, then destroy other rule card. (&ldquo;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&rdquo;) The rule book is also designed to change as the game continues and the game box itself contains different sealed compartments, each with a written condition for opening. They contain the rule additions, faction powers, anda few other surprises. Unlock new rules and watch events unfold as no two games will EVER be the same.

The secret is not to think too deeply. Simply &#39;gulp&#39; in the images and start talking. And remember, there is no wrong answer! The nine dice, each with a unique image on all six sides, hold a total of 54 images. This means that with every roll, there are over 10 million combination&#39;s for you to use as the inspiration for your story. The uses for Rory&#39;s Story Cubes are boundless.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the &#39;island&#39;, which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made. What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image. With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.

To set up the game, players choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what&#39;s available. Players then choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain&#39;s attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain&#39;s particular scheme. Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of six cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player&#39;s turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action. As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game&#39;s end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all lose. Players create their own powerful combos on the fly, combining their heroes awesome abilities to take down nasty Marvel supervillians like Venom and Mystique. Over the course of the game, recruit increasingly powerful Hero cards to add to your deck, building a stronger and stronger deck of the ultimate Marvel superhero combinations Innovative &quot;Mastermind&quot; mechanics allow the game itself to fight back again the players: If players aren&#39;t careful, villainous Marvel masterminds like Magneto, Loki and Dr Doom threaten to accomplish dark schemes and defeat all the players at once!

Suddenly, a rain of arrows darken the sky: It&#39;s an Indian attack! Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you? Bang! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game. Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else&#39;s) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table. If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who&#39;ll get his shot off first?

Icon relationships, the escalation die are unique features which offer exciting storytelling possibilities with simple yet powerful skill rules and fun, fast-moving combat. In the 13th Age of the world, adventurers seek their fortunes in the Dragon Empire while powerful individuals known as Icons pursue goals that may preserve the empire from chaos, or send it over the edge. Players decide which Icons their characters ally with, and which ones they oppose. These relationships, along with a personal history and a unique trait chosen during character creation, help define an adventurer&#39;s place in the world of 13th Age and lay the groundwork for epic stories that emerge through play. There are also fun new rules for hitting and defeating orcs. 13th Age was playtested in 2012 by more than 200 gaming groups around the world. &quot;Our goal with 13th Age is to recapture the free-wheeling style of old-school gaming by creating a game with more soul and fewer technical details. ...13th Age makes the play group&#39;s campaign the center of attention, with a toolkit of rules that you can pick and choose from based on the kind of game you want to play.
